        "instructions": "<p>You have now been sworn as jurors in this case. I want to impress on you the seriousness and importance of serving on a jury. Trial by jury is a fundamental right in California. The parties have a right to a jury that is selected fairly, that comes to the case without bias, and that will attempt to reach a verdict based on the evidence presented. Before we begin, I need to explain how you must conduct yourselves during the trial.</p><p>Do not allow anything that happens outside this courtroom to affect your decision. During the trial do not talk about this case or the people involved in it with anyone, including family and persons living in your household, friends and co-workers, spiritual leaders, advisors, or therapists. You may say you are on a jury and how long the trial may take, but that is all. You must not even talk about the case with the other jurors until after I tell you that it is time for you to decide the case.</p><p>This prohibition is not limited to face-to-face conversations. It also extends to all forms of electronic communications. Do not use any electronic device or media, such as a cell phone or smart phone, PDA, computer, the Internet, any Internet service, any text or instant- messaging service, any Internet chat room, blog, or website, including social networking websites or online diaries, to send or receive any information to or from anyone about this case or your experience as a juror until after you have been discharged from your jury duty.</p><p>During the trial you must not listen to anyone else talk about the case or the people involved in the case. You must avoid any contact with the parties, the lawyers, the witnesses, and anyone else who may have a connection to the case. If anyone tries to talk to you about this case, tell that person that you cannot discuss it because you are a juror. If he or she keeps talking to you, simply walk away and report the incident to the court [attendant/bailiff] as soon as you can.</p><p>After the trial is over and I have released you from jury duty, you may discuss the case with anyone, but you are not required to do so.</p><p>During the trial, do not read, listen to, or watch any news reports about this case. [I have no information that there will be news reports concerning this case.] This prohibition extends to the use of the Internet in any way, including reading any blog about the case or about anyone involved with it. If you receive any information about this case from any source outside of the courtroom, promptly report it to the court [attendant/bailiff]. It is important that all jurors see and hear the same evidence at the same time.</p><p>Do not do any research on your own or as a group. Do not use dictionaries, the Internet, or other reference materials. Do not investigate the case or conduct any experiments. Do not contact anyone to assist you, such as a family accountant, doctor, or lawyer. Do not visit or view the scene of any event involved in this case or use any Internet maps or mapping programs or any other program or device to search for or to view any place discussed in the testimony. If you happen to pass by the scene, do not stop or investigate. If you do need to view the scene during the trial, you will be taken there as a group under proper supervision.</p><p>[If you violate any of these prohibitions on communications and research, including prohibitions on electronic communications and research, you may be held in contempt of court or face other sanctions. That means that you may have to serve time in jail, pay a fine, or face other punishment for that violation.]</p><p>It is important that you keep an open mind throughout this trial. Evidence can only be presented a piece at a time. Do not form or express an opinion about this case while the trial is going on. You must not decide on a verdict until after you have heard all the evidence and have discussed it thoroughly with your fellow jurors in your deliberations.</p><p>Do not concern yourselves with the reasons for the rulings I will make during the course of the trial. Do not guess what I may think your verdict should be from anything I might say or do.</p><p>When you begin your deliberations, you may discuss the case only in the jury room and only when all the jurors are present.</p><p>You must decide what the facts are in this case. Do not let bias, sympathy, prejudice, or public opinion influence your verdict.</p><p>At the end of the trial, I will explain the law that you must follow to reach your verdict. You must follow the law as I explain it to you, even if you do not agree with the law.</p><p><em>New September 2003; Revised April 2004, October 2004, February 2005, June 2005, December 2007, December 2009, December 2011, December 2012</em></p>"

As one side presents evidence, the other side has the right to object and to ask me to decide if the evidence is permitted by the rules. Usually, I will decide immediately, but sometimes I may have to hear arguments outside of your presence.</p><p>After the evidence has been presented, I will instruct you on the law that applies to the case and the attorneys will make closing arguments.

The situations are (1) where the person who makes the statement is in privity with the party against whom it is offered, as in the case of agency, partnership, etc.; and (2) where the statement of the other is adopted by the party as his own, either expressly or by conduct. Familiar examples of this second situation are the admissions by silence, where declarations of third persons made in the presence of a party give rise to admissions, the conduct of the party in the face of the declaration constituting the adoption of the statement to form an admission.\u201d (In re Estate of Gaines (1940) 15 Cal.2d 255, 262 [100 P.2d 1055].)</li><li>\u201cThe basis of the rule on admissions made in response to accusations is the fact that human experience has shown that generally it is natural to deny an accusation if a party considers himself innocent of negligence or wrongdoing.\u201d (Keller v. Key System Transit Lines (1954) 129 Cal.App.2d 593, 596 [277 P.2d 869].)</li><li>If the statement is not accusatory, then the failure to respond is not an admission.

City of Los Angeles (1967) 249 Cal.App.2d 1006, 1008 [58 Cal.Rptr. 56].)</li><li>Admissibility of this evidence depends upon whether (1) the statement was made under circumstances that call for a reply, (2) whether the party understood the statement, and (3) whether it could be inferred from his conduct that he adopted the statement as an admission.

As pointed out by the California Supreme Court, \u2018two separate and distinct testimonial privileges\u2019 exist under this guarantee. First, a defendant in a criminal case \u2018has an absolute right not to be called as a witness and not to testify.\u2019 Second, \u2018in any proceeding, civil or criminal, a witness has the right to decline to answer questions which may tend to incriminate him [or her] in criminal activity.\u2019 \u201d (People v.

Upon request, the trial court must so instruct jurors. \u2018To avoid the potentially prejudicial impact of having a witness assert the privilege against self-incrimination before the jury, we have in the past recommended that, in determining the propriety of the witness\u2019s invocation of the privilege, the trial court hold a pretestimonial hearing outside the jury\u2019s presence.\u2019 Such a procedure makes sense under the appropriate circumstances. If there is a dispute about whether a witness may legitimately rely on the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination to avoid testifying, that legal question should be resolved by the court. Given the court\u2019s ruling and the nature of the potential testimony, the witness may not be privileged to testify at all, or counsel may elect not to call the witness as a matter of tactics.\u201d (People v.

Typically, those claiming such coercion are attempting to avoid the consequences of a modification of an original contract or of a settlement and release agreement. On the one hand, courts are reluctant to set aside agreements because of the notion of freedom of contract and because of the desirability of having private dispute resolutions be final. On the other hand, there is an increasing recognition of the law\u2019s role in correcting inequitable or unequal exchanges between parties of disproportionate bargaining power and a greater willingness to not enforce agreements which were entered into under coercive circumstances.\u2019 \u201d (Rich &amp; Whillock, Inc., supra, 157 Cal.App.3d at p. 1158.)</li><li>\u201c \u2018As it has evolved to the present day, the economic duress doctrine is not limited by early statutory and judicial expressions requiring an unlawful act in the nature of a tort or a crime. . . . Instead, the doctrine now may come into play upon the doing of a wrongful act which is sufficiently coercive to cause a reasonably prudent person faced with no reasonable alternative to succumb to the perpetrator\u2019s pressure. . . . The assertion of a claim known to be false or a bad faith threat to breach a contract or to withhold a payment may constitute a wrongful act for purposes of the economic duress doctrine. . . . Further, a reasonably prudent person subject to such an act may have no reasonable alternative but to succumb when the only other alternative is bankruptcy or financial ruin. . . .\u2019 \u201d (Chan, supra, 188 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1173\u20131174.)</li><li>\u201c \u2018It is not duress . . . to take a different view of contract rights, even though mistaken, from that of the other contracting party, and it is not duress to refuse, in good faith, to proceed with a contract, even though such refusal might later be found to be wrong. [\u00b6] . . . \u201cA mere threat to withhold a legal right for the enforcement of which a person has an adequate [legal] remedy is not duress.\u201d \u2019 \u201d (River Bank America, supra, 38 Cal.App.4th at p. 1425.)</li><li>\u201c[W]rongful acts will support a claim of economic duress when \u2018a reasonably prudent person subject to such an act may have no reasonable alternative but to succumb when the only other alternative is bankruptcy or financial ruin.\u2019 \u201d (Uniwill, supra, 124 Cal.App.4th at p. 545.)</li><li>\u201cEconomic duress has been recognized as a basis for rescinding a settlement.

Baxendale, . . . that is, they must reasonably be supposed to have been contemplated or foreseeable by the parties when making the contract as the probable result of a breach. If special circumstances cause an unusual injury, special damages cannot be recovered unless the circumstances were known or should have been known to the party at fault at the time the contract was made.\u201d (Sabraw v. Kaplan (1962) 211 Cal.App.2d 224, 227 [27 Cal.Rptr. 81], internal citations omitted.)</li><li>\u201cWhen reference is made to the terms of the contract alone, there is ordinarily little difficulty in determining what damages arise from its breach in the usual course of things, and the parties will be presumed to have contemplated such damages only. But where it is claimed the circumstances show that a special purpose was intended to be accomplished by one of the parties (a failure to accomplish which by means of the contract would cause him greater damage than would ordinarily follow from a breach by the other party), and such purpose was known to the other party, the facts showing the special purpose and the knowledge of the other party must be averred. This rule has frequently been applied to the breach of a contract for the sale of goods to be delivered at a certain time. In such cases the general rule of damages is fixed by reference to the market value of the goods at the time they were to have been delivered, because in the usual course of events the purchaser could have supplied himself with like commodities at the market price. And if special circumstances existed entitling the purchaser to greater damages for the defeat of a special purpose known to the contracting parties (as, for example, if the purchaser had already contracted to furnish the goods at a profit, and they could not be obtained in the market), such circumstances must be stated in the declaration with the facts which, under the circumstances, enhanced the injury.\u201d (Mitchell v.

But neither the instructions nor the special verdict form told the jury how to avoid awarding duplicative damages. With a single general verdict or a general verdict with special findings, where the verdict includes a total damages award, the jury presumably will follow the instruction (such as the one given here) and ensure that the total damages award includes no duplicative amounts. A special verdict on multiple counts, however, is different. If the jury finds the amount of damages separately for each count and does not calculate the total damages award, as here, the jury has no opportunity to eliminate any duplicative amounts in calculating the total award. Absent any instruction specifically informing the jury how to properly avoid awarding duplicative damages, it might have attempted to do so by finding no liability or no damages on certain counts, resulting in an inconsistent verdict.\u201d (Singh, supra, 186 Cal.App.4th at p. 360.)</li></ul>",

While the court deciding duty assesses the foreseeability of injury from \u2018the category of negligent conduct at issue,\u2019 if the defendant did owe the plaintiff a duty of ordinary care the jury \u2018may consider the likelihood or foreseeability of injury in determining whether, in fact, the particular defendant\u2019s conduct was negligent in the first place.\u2019 An approach that instead focused the duty inquiry on case- specific facts would tend to \u2018eliminate the role of the jury in negligence cases, transforming the question of whether a defendant breached the duty of care under the facts of a particular case into a legal issue to be decided by the court . . . .\u2019 \u201d (Cabral, supra, 51 Cal.4th at pp. 772\u2013773, original italics, internal citations omitted.)</li><li>\u201c[W]hile foreseeability with respect to duty is determined by focusing on the general character of the event and inquiring whether such event is \u2018likely enough in the setting of modern life that a reasonably thoughtful [person] would take account of it in guiding practical conduct\u2019, foreseeability in evaluating negligence and causation requires a \u2018more focused, fact-specific\u2019 inquiry that takes into account a particular plaintiff\u2019s injuries and the particular defendant\u2019s conduct.\u201d (Laabs v.

The Supreme Court has stated that \u201cit is well established that defendants generally do have a duty to use due care not to increase the risks to a participant over and above those inherent in the sport.\u201d Thus, even though \u201cdefendants generally have no legal duty to eliminate (or protect a plaintiff against) risks inherent in the sport itself,\u201d they may not increase the likelihood of injury above that which is inherent.\u2019 \u201d (Distefano v.

Rather, it requires application of the governing standard of care (the duty not to increase the risks inherent in the sport) to the facts of this particular case\u2014the traditional role of the trier of fact.

Bear Valley Ski Co., supra, 118 Cal.App.4th at pp. 591\u2013592 [whether defendant\u2019s design of snowboard jump increased inherent risks of snowboarding is question for jury]; Solis v.

Wilkins, supra, 138 Cal.App.4th at p. 745 [\u2018it is the trial court\u2019s province to determine whether defendants breached their duty not to increase the inherent risk of a collision [in the sport of off-roading], and it should hold a hearing for this purpose before impaneling a jury\u2019]; American Golf Corp. v. Superior Court (2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 30, 37 [93 Cal.Rptr.2d 683] [\u2018[i]t is for the court to decide . . . whether the defendant has increased the risks of the activity beyond the risks inherent in the sport\u2019]; see also Huffman v.

[\u00b6] Our conclusion it is for the trier of fact to determine whether [defendant] breached his limited duty not to increase the risks inherent in the sport of volleyball finds solid support in the Supreme Court\u2019s most recent sports injury, primary assumption of the risk decision, Shin v. Ahn, supra, 42 Cal.4th 482, a case that postdates the appellate court decisions suggesting the issue is one for the court to resolve.\u201d (Luna v. Vela (2008) 169 Cal.App.4th 102, 112\u2013113 [86 Cal.Rptr.3d 588].)</li><li>\u201cPrimary assumption of the risk is an objective test. It does not depend on a particular plaintiff\u2019s subjective knowledge or appreciation of the potential for risk.\u201d (Saville, supra, 133 Cal.App.4th at p 866.)</li><li>\u201cA jury could find that, by using a snowboard without the retention strap, in violation of the rules of the ski resort and a county ordinance, defendant unnecessarily increased the danger that his snowboard might escape his control and injure other participants such as plaintiff. The absence of a retention strap could therefore constitute conduct not inherent to the sport which increased the risk of injury.\u201d (Campbell v. Derylo (1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 823, 829 [89 Cal.Rptr.2d 519].)</li><li>\u201cThe existence and scope of a defendant\u2019s duty depends on the role that defendant played in the activity. Defendants were merely the hosts of a social gathering at their cattle ranch, where [plaintiff] asked to ride one of their horses; they were not instructors and did not assume any of the responsibilities of an instructor.\u201d (Levinson v. Owens (2009) 176 Cal.App.4th 1534, 1550\u20131551 [98 Cal.Rptr.3d 779], internal citation omitted.)</li><li>\u201c[T]he doctrine [of primary assumption of risk] applies not only to sports, but to other activities involving an inherent risk of injury to voluntary participants . . . , where the risk cannot be eliminated without altering the fundamental nature of the activity.\u201d (Beninati v. Black Rock City, LLC (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 650, 658 [96 Cal.Rptr.3d 105].)</li><li>\u201cWhether a duty exists \u2018does not turn on the reasonableness or unreasonableness of the plaintiff\u2019s conduct, but rather on [(1)] the nature of the activity or sport in which the defendant is engaged and [(2)] the relationship of the defendant and the plaintiff to that activity or sport.\u2019 It is the \u2018nature of the activity\u2019 and the parties\u2019 relationship to it that determines whether the doctrine applies\u2014not its characterization as a sporting event.\u201d (McGarry, supra, 158 Cal.App.4th at p. 999, internal citations omitted.)</li><li>\u201c[T]o the extent that \u2018 \u201c \u2018a plaintiff unreasonably undertakes to encounter a specific known risk imposed by a defendant\u2019s negligence,\u2019 \u201d \u2019 he or she is subject to the defense of comparative negligence but not to an absolute defense. This type of comparative negligence has been referred to as \u2018 \u201csecondary assumption of risk.\u201d \u2019 Assumption of risk that is based upon the absence of a defendant\u2019s duty of care is called \u2018 \u201cprimary assumption of risk.\u201d \u2019 \u2018First, in \u201cprimary assumption of risk\u201d cases\u2014where the defendant owes no duty to protect the plaintiff from a particular risk of harm\u2014a plaintiff who has suffered such harm is not entitled to recover from the defendant, whether the plaintiff\u2019s conduct in undertaking the activity was reasonable or unreasonable. Second, in \u201csecondary assumption of risk\u201d cases\u2014involving instances in which the defendant has breached the duty of care owed to the plaintiff\u2014the defendant is not entitled to be entirely relieved of liability for an injury proximately caused by such breach, simply because the plaintiff\u2019s conduct in encountering the risk of such an injury was reasonable rather than unreasonable.\u2019 \u201d (Kindrich v. Long Beach Yacht Club (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 1252, 1259 [84 Cal.Rptr.3d 824], original italics, internal citations omitted.)</li><li>\u201cEven were we to conclude that [plaintiff]\u2019s decision to jump off the boat was a voluntary one, and that therefore he assumed a risk inherent in doing so, this is not enough to provide a complete defense. Because voluntary assumption of risk as a complete defense in a negligence action was abandoned in Li v. Yellow Cab Co. (1975) 13 Cal.3d 804, 829 [119 Cal.Rptr. 858, 532 P.2d 1226], only the absence of duty owed a plaintiff under the doctrine of primary assumption of risk would provide such a defense. But that doctrine does not come into play except when a plaintiff and a defendant are engaged in certain types of activities, such as an \u2018active sport.\u2019 That was not the case here; plaintiff was merely the passenger on a boat. Under Li, he may have been contributorily negligent but this would only go to reduce the amount of damages to which he is entitled.\u201d (Kindrich, supra, 167 Cal.App.4th at p. 1258.)</li></ul>",

Instead, we deal with the duty of a coach or trainer to a student who has entrusted himself to the former\u2019s tutelage. There are precedents reaching back for most of this century that find an absence of duty to coparticipants and, often, to spectators, but the law is otherwise as applied to coaches and instructors. For them, the general rule is that coaches and instructors owe a duty of due care to persons in their charge. The coach or instructor is not, of course, an insurer, and a student may be held to notice that which is obvious and to ask appropriate questions. But all of the authorities that comment on the issue have recognized the existence of a duty of care.\u201d (Tan v. Goddard (1993) 13 Cal.App.4th 1528, 1535\u20131536 [17 Cal.Rptr.2d 89, internal citations omitted.)</li><li>\u201c[D]ecisions have clarified that the risks associated with learning a sport may themselves be inherent risks of the sport, and that an instructor or coach generally does not increase the risk of harm inherent in learning the sport simply by urging the student to strive to excel or to reach a new level of competence.\u201d (Kahn, supra, 31 Cal.4th at p. 1006.)</li><li>\u201cTo the extent a duty is alleged against a coach for \u2018pushing\u2019 and/or \u2018challenging\u2019 a student to improve and advance, the plaintiff must show that the coach intended to cause the student\u2019s injury or engaged in reckless conduct\u2014that is, conduct totally outside the range of the ordinary activity involved in teaching or coaching the sport. Furthermore, a coach has a duty of ordinary care not to increase the risk of injury to a student by encouraging or allowing the student to participate in the sport when he or she is physically unfit to participate or by allowing the student to use unsafe equipment or instruments.\u201d (Eriksson, supra, 191 Cal.App.4th at p. 845, internal citation omitted.)</li><li>\u201c[T]he mere existence of an instructor/pupil relationship does not necessarily preclude application of \u2018primary assumption of the risk.\u2019 Learning any sport inevitably involves attempting new skills. A coach or instructor will often urge the student to go beyond what the student has already mastered; that is the nature of (inherent in) sports instruction.\u201d (Allan v. Snow Summit, Inc.

Thus, although a ski resort has no duty to remove moguls from a ski run, it clearly does have a duty to use due care to maintain its towropes in a safe, working condition so as not to expose skiers to an increased risk of harm. The cases establish that the latter type of risk, posed by a ski resort\u2019s negligence, clearly is not a risk (inherent in the sport) that is assumed by a participant.\u2019 \u201d (Fortier v.

(2010) 189 Cal.App.4th 1155, 1163\u20131164 [117 Cal.Rptr.3d 126].)</p><p>If the plaintiff has established the three conditions that give rise to the doctrine, the jury is required to find that the accident resulted from the defendant\u2019s negligence unless the defendant comes forward with evidence that would support a contrary finding. (See Cal. Law Revision Com. Comment to Evid. Code, \u00a7 646.) The last two paragraphs of the instruction assume that the defendant has presented evidence that would support a finding that the defendant was not negligent or that any negligence on the defendant\u2019s part was not a proximate cause of the accident. In this case, the presumption drops out, and the plaintiff must then prove the elements of negligence without the benefit of the presumption of res ipsa loquitur. (See Howe, supra, 189 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1163\u20131164; see also Evid. Code, \u00a7 646(c).)</p>",

Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent the drawing of any inference that may be appropriate.\u201d</p></div></li><li>\u201cIn California, the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur is defined by statute as \u2018a presumption affecting the burden of producing evidence.\u2019 The presumption arises when the evidence satisfies three conditions: \u2018(1) the accident must be of a kind which ordinarily does not occur in the absence of someone\u2019s negligence; (2) it must be caused by an agency or instrumentality within the exclusive control of the defendant; (3) it must not have been due to any voluntary action or contribution on the part of the plaintiff.\u2019 A presumption affecting the burden of producing evidence \u2018require[s] the trier of fact to assume the existence of the presumed fact\u2019 unless the defendant introduces evidence to the contrary. The presumed fact, in this context, is that \u2018a proximate cause of the occurrence was some negligent conduct on the part of the defendant . . . .\u2019 If the defendant introduces \u2018evidence which would support a finding that he was not negligent or that any negligence on his part was not a proximate cause of the occurrence,\u2019 the trier of fact determines whether defendant was negligent without regard to the presumption, simply by weighing the evidence.\u201d (Brown v. Poway Unified School Dist. (1993) 4 Cal.4th 820, 825\u2013826 [15 Cal.Rptr.2d 679, 843 P.2d 624], internal citations omitted.)</li><li>\u201c \u2018The doctrine of res ipsa loquitur is applicable where the accident is of such a nature that it can be said, in the light of past experience, that it probably was the result of negligence by someone and that the defendant is probably the one responsible.\u2019 \u201d (Howe, supra, 189 Cal.App.4th at p. 1161.)</li><li>\u201cRes ipsa loquitur is an evidentiary rule for \u2018determining whether circumstantial evidence of negligence is sufficient.\u2019 \u201d (Howe, supra, 189 Cal.App.4th at p. 1161, internal citation omitted.)</li><li>The doctrine \u201cis based on a theory of \u2018probability\u2019 where there is no direct evidence of defendant\u2019s conduct, permitting a common sense inference of negligence from the happening of the accident.\u201d (Gicking v. Kimberlin (1985) 170 Cal.App.3d 73, 75 [215 Cal.Rptr. 834].)</li><li>\u201cAll of the cases hold, in effect, that it must appear, either as a matter of common experience or from evidence in the case, that the accident is of a type which probably would not happen unless someone was negligent.\u201d (Zentz v. Coca Cola Bottling Co. of Fresno (1952) 39 Cal.2d 436, 442\u2013443 [247 P.2d 344].)</li><li>The purpose of the second \u201ccontrol\u201d requirement is to \u201clink the defendant with the probability, already established, that the accident was negligently caused.\u201d (Newing v. Cheatham (1975) 15 Cal.3d 351, 362 [124 Cal.Rptr. 193, 540 P.2d 33].)</li><li>\u201cThe purpose of [the third] requirement, like that of control by the defendant is to establish that the defendant is the one probably responsible for the accident. The plaintiff need not show that he was entirely inactive at the time of the accident in order to satisfy this requirement, so long as the evidence is such as to eliminate his conduct as a factor contributing to the occurrence.\u201d (Newing, supra, 15 Cal.3d at p. 363, internal citations omitted.)</li><li>The third condition \u201cshould not be confused with the problem of contributory negligence, as to which defendant has the burden of proof. . . . [I]ts purpose, like that of control by the defendant, is merely to assist the court in determining whether it is more probable than not that the defendant was responsible for the accident.\u201d (Zentz, supra, 39 Cal.2d at p. 444.)</li><li>\u201c[Evidence Code section 646] . . . classified the doctrine as a presumption affecting the burden of producing evidence. Under that classification, when the predicate facts are established to give rise to the presumption, the burden of producing evidence to rebut it shifts to the defendant to prove lack of negligence or lack of proximate cause that the injury claimed was the result of that negligence. As a presumption affecting the burden of producing evidence (as distinguished from a presumption affecting the burden of proof), if evidence is presented to rebut the presumed fact, the presumption is out of the case\u2014it \u2018disappears.\u2019 But if no such evidence is submitted, the trier of fact must find the presumed fact to be established.\u201d (Howe, supra, 189 Cal.App.4th at p. 1162.)</li><li>\u201c \u2018If evidence is produced that would support a finding that the defendant was not negligent or that any negligence on his part was not a proximate cause of the accident, the presumptive effect of the doctrine vanishes.\u2019 \u2018[T]he mere introduction of evidence sufficient to sustain a finding of the nonexistence of the presumed fact causes the presumption, as a matter of law, to disappear.\u2019 When the presumptive effect vanishes, it is the plaintiff\u2019s burden to introduce actual evidence that would show that the defendant is negligent and that such negligence was the proximate cause of the accident.\u201d (Howe, supra, 189 Cal.App.4th at p. 1163, internal citations omitted.)</li><li>\u201cAs the [Law Revision Commission] Comment [to Evidence Code section 646] explains, even though the presumptive effect of the doctrine vanishes, \u2018the jury may still be able to draw an inference that the accident was caused by the defendant\u2019s lack of due care from the facts that gave rise to the presumption. . . . [\u00b6] . . . [\u00b6] . . . An inference of negligence may well be warranted from all of the evidence in the case even though the plaintiff fails to establish all the elements of res ipsa loquitur. In appropriate cases, therefore, the jury may be instructed that, even though it does not find that the facts giving rise to the presumption have been proved by a preponderance of the evidence, it may nevertheless find the defendant negligent if it concludes from a consideration of all the evidence that it is more probable than not that the defendant was negligent.\u2019 \u201d (Howe, supra, 189 Cal.App.4th at p. 1163, internal citation omitted.)</li><li>\u201cIt follows that where part of the facts basic to the application of the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur is established as a matter of law but that others are not, the court should instruct that application of the doctrine by the jury depends only upon the existence of the basic facts not conclusively established.\u201d (Rimmele v.

        "sources_and_authority": "<ul><li>Evidence Code section 669 codifies the common law presumption of negligence per se and the grounds for rebutting the presumption. Subdivision (a) sets forth the conditions that cause the presumption to arise:<p>The failure of a person to exercise due care is presumed if:</p><div ><p>(1)    He violated a statute, ordinance, or regulation of a public entity;</p><p>(2)    The violation proximately caused death or injury to person or property;</p><p>(3)    The death or injury resulted from an occurrence of the nature which the statute, ordinance, or regulation was designed to prevent; and</p><p>(4)    The person suffering the death or the injury to his person or property was one of the class of persons for whose protection the statute, ordinance, or regulation was adopted.</p></div></li><li>\u201cAlthough compliance with the law does not prove the absence of negligence, violation of the law does raise a presumption that the violator was negligent. This is called negligence per se. The presumption of negligence arises if (1) the defendant violated a statute; (2) the violation proximately caused the plaintiff\u2019s injury; (3) the injury resulted from the kind of occurrence the statute was designed to prevent; and (4) the plaintiff was one of the class of persons the statute was intended to protect. The first two elements are normally questions for the trier of fact and the last two are determined by the trial court as a matter of law. That is, the trial court decides whether a statute or regulation defines the standard of care in a particular case.\u201d (Jacobs Farm/Del Cabo, Inc. v. Western Farm Service, Inc. (2010) 190 Cal.App.4th 1502, 1526 [119 Cal.Rptr.3d 529], internal citations omitted; see also Cal. Law Revision Com. to Evid.

Russell (1982) 138 Cal.App.3d 379, 383 [188 Cal.Rptr. 18].)</li><li>\u201c \u2018The significance of a statute in a civil suit for negligence lies in its formulation of a standard of conduct that the court adopts in the determination of such liability. The decision as to what the civil standard should be still rests with the court, and the standard formulated by a legislative body in a police regulation or criminal statute becomes the standard to determine civil liability only because the court accepts it. In the absence of such a standard the case goes to the jury, which must determine whether the defendant has acted as a reasonably prudent man would act in similar circumstances. The jury then has the burden of deciding not only what the facts are but what the unformulated standard is of reasonable conduct. When a legislative body has generalized a standard from the experience of the community and prohibits conduct that is likely to cause harm, the court accepts the formulated standards and applies them [citations], except where they would serve to impose liability without fault.\u2019 \u201d (Ramirez v.

        "sources_and_authority": "<ul><li>\u201cThe test for joint tort liability is set forth in section 431 of the Restatement of Torts 2d, which provides: \u2018The actor\u2019s negligent conduct is a legal cause of harm to another if (a) his conduct is a substantial factor in bringing about the harm, and, (b) there is no rule of law relieving the actor from liability because of the manner in which his negligence has resulted in the harm.\u2019 Section 431 correctly states California law as to the issue of causation in tort cases.\u201d (<i>Wilson v. Blue Cross of So. Cal.</i> (1990) 222 Cal.App.3d 660, 671\u2014672 [271 Cal.Rptr. 876].)</li><li>\u201cCalifornia has definitively adopted the substantial factor test of the Restatement Second of Torts for cause-in-fact determinations. Under that standard, a cause in fact is something that is a substantial factor in bringing about the injury. The substantial factor standard generally produces the same results as does the \u2018but for\u2019 rule of causation which states that a defendant\u2019s conduct is a cause of the injury if the injury would not have occurred \u2018but for\u2019 that conduct. The substantial factor standard, however, has been embraced as a clearer rule of causation\u2014one which subsumes the \u2018but for\u2019 test while reaching beyond it to satisfactorily address other situations, such as those involving independent or concurrent causes in fact.\u201d (<i>Rutherford, supra,</i> 16 Cal.4th at pp. 968\u2014969, internal citations omitted.)</li><li>\u201cThe term \u2018substantial factor\u2019 has not been judicially defined with specificity, and indeed it has been observed that it is \u2018neither possible nor desirable to reduce it to any lower terms.\u2019 This court has suggested that a force which plays only an \u2018infinitesimal\u2019 or \u2018theoretical\u2019 part in bringing about injury, damage, or loss is not a substantial factor. Undue emphasis should not be placed on the term \u2018substantial.\u2019 For example, the substantial factor standard, formulated to aid plaintiffs as a broader rule of causality than the \u2018but for\u2019 test, has been invoked by defendants whose conduct is clearly a \u2018but for\u2019 cause of plaintiff\u2019s injury but is nevertheless urged as an insubstantial contribution to the injury. Misused in this way, the substantial factor test \u2018undermines the principles of comparative negligence, under which a party is responsible for his or her share of negligence and the harm caused thereby.\u2019 \u201d (<i>Rutherford, supra,</i> 16 Cal.4th at pp. 968\u2014969, internal citations omitted.)</li><li>\u201cThe substantial factor standard is a relatively broad one, requiring only that the contribution of the individual cause be more than negligible or theoretical. Thus, \u2018a force which plays only an \u201cinfinitesimal\u201d or \u201ctheoretical\u201d part in bringing about injury, damage, or loss is not a substantial factor\u2019, but a very minor force that does cause harm is a substantial factor. This rule honors the principle of comparative fault.\u201d (<i>Bockrath v. Aldrich Chemical Co.</i> (1999) 21 Cal.4th 71, 79 [86 Cal.Rptr.2d 846, 980 P.2d 398], internal citations omitted.)</li><li>\u201cThe text of Restatement Torts second section 432 demonstrates how the \u2018substantial factor\u2019 test subsumes the traditional \u2018but for\u2019 test of causation. Subsection (1) of section 432 provides: \u2018Except as stated in Subsection (2), the actor\u2019s negligent conduct <i>is not a substantial factor</i> in bringing about harm to another <i>if the harm would have been sustained even if the actor had not been negligent</i>.\u2019 . . . Subsection (2) states that if \u2018two forces are actively operating . . . and each of itself is sufficient to bring about harm to another, the actor\u2019s negligence may be found to be a substantial factor in bringing it about.\u2019 \u201d (<i>Viner, supra,</i> 30 Cal. 4th at p. 1240, original italics.)</li><li>\u201cA tort is a legal cause of injury only when it is a substantial factor in producing the injury. If the external force of a vehicle accident was so severe that it would have caused identical injuries notwithstanding an abstract \u2018defect\u2019 in the vehicle\u2019s collision safety, the defect cannot be considered a substantial factor in bringing them about. [\u00b6] The general causation instruction given by the trial court correctly advised that plaintiff could not recover for a design defect unless it was a \u2018substantial factor\u2019 in producing plaintiff\u2019s \u2018enhanced\u2019 injuries. However, this instruction dealt only by \u2018negative implication\u2019 with [defendant]\u2019s theory that any such defect was not a \u2018substantial factor\u2019 in this case because this particular accident would have broken plaintiff\u2019s ankles in any event. As we have seen, [defendant] presented substantial evidence to that effect. [Defendant] was therefore entitled to its special instruction, and the trial court\u2019s refusal to give it was error.\u201d (<i>Soule, supra,</i> 8 Cal.4th at p. 572\u2014573, original italics, footnote and internal citations omitted.)</li><li>\u201cThe first element of legal cause is cause in fact \u2026 The \u2018but for\u2019 rule has traditionally been applied to determine cause in fact. The Restatement formula uses the term <i>substantial factor</i> \u2018to denote the fact that the defendant\u2019s conduct has such an effect in producing the harm as to lead reasonable men to regard it as a cause.\u2019 \u201d (<i>Mayes v. Bryan</i> (2006) 139 Cal.App.4th 1075, 1095 [44 Cal.Rptr.3d 14], internal citations omitted.)</li><li>\u201c \u2018Whether a defendant\u2019s conduct actually caused an injury is a question of fact . . . that is ordinarily for the jury \u2026\u2019 \u2018[C]ausation in fact is ultimately a matter of probability and common sense: \u201c[A plaintiff] is not required to eliminate entirely all possibility that the defendant\u2019s conduct was not a cause. It is enough that he introduces evidence from which reasonable [persons] may conclude that it is more probable that the event was caused by the defendant than that it was not. The fact of causation is incapable of mathematical proof, since no [person] can say with absolute certainty what would have occurred if the defendant had acted otherwise. If, as a matter of ordinary experience, a particular act or omission might be expected to produce a particular result, and if that result has in fact followed, the conclusion may be justified that the causal relation exists. In drawing that conclusion, the triers of fact are permitted to draw upon ordinary human experience as to the probabilities of the case.\u201d \u2019 . . . \u2018 \u201cA mere possibility of . . . causation is not enough; and when the matter remains one of pure speculation or conjecture, or the probabilities are at best evenly balanced, it becomes the duty of the court to direct a verdict for the defendant.\u201d \u2019 \u201d (<i>Raven H. v.

This question, in turn, revolves around a determination of whether the later cause of independent origin, commonly referred to as an intervening cause, was foreseeable by the defendant or, if not foreseeable, whether it caused injury of a type which was foreseeable. If either of these questions is answered in the affirmative, then the defendant is not relieved from liability towards the plaintiff; if, however, it is determined that the intervening cause was not foreseeable and that the results which it caused were not foreseeable, then the intervening cause becomes a supervening cause and the defendant is relieved from liability for the plaintiff\u2019s injuries.\u201d (<i>Akins v.

Under these rules the fact that an intervening act of a third person is done in a negligent manner does not make it a superseding cause if a reasonable man knowing the situation existing when the act of the third person is done would not regard it as highly extraordinary that the third person so acted or the act is a normal response to a situation created by the defendant\u2019s conduct and the manner in which the intervening act is done is not extraordinarily negligent.\u201d (<i>Stewart v.

In an asbestos-related cancer case, the plaintiff need not prove that fibers from the defendant\u2019s product were the ones, or among the ones, that actually began the process of malignant cellular growth. Instead, the plaintiff may meet the burden of proving that exposure to defendant\u2019s product was a substantial factor causing the illness by showing that in reasonable medical probability it was a substantial factor contributing to the plaintiff\u2019s or decedent\u2019s risk of developing cancer.

In Viner, the court noted that subsection (1) of section 432 of the Restatement Second of Torts, which provides that \u2018the actor\u2019s negligent conduct is not a substantial factor in bringing about harm to another if the harm would have been sustained even if the actor had not been negligent,\u2019 \u2018demonstrates how the \u201csubstantial factor\u201d test subsumes the traditional \u201cbut for\u201d test of causation.\u2019 Defendant argues that Viner required plaintiffs to show that defendant\u2019s product \u2018independently caused [plaintiff\u2019s] injury or that, but for that exposure, [plaintiff] would not have contracted lung cancer.\u2019 Viner, however, is a legal malpractice case. It does not address the explicit holding in Rutherford that \u2018plaintiffs may prove causation in asbestos-related cancer cases by demonstrating that the plaintiff\u2019s exposure to defendant\u2019s asbestos-containing product in reasonable medical probability was a substantial factor in contributing to the aggregate dose of asbestos the plaintiff or decedent inhaled or ingested, and hence to the risk of developing asbestos-related cancer, without the need to demonstrate that fibers from the defendant\u2019s particular product were the ones, or among the ones, that actually produced the malignant growth.\u2019 \u201d Viner is consistent with Rutherford insofar as Rutherford requires proof that an individual asbestos-containing product is a substantial factor contributing to the plaintiff\u2019s risk or probability of developing cancer.\u201d (Jones v.

        "directions_for_use": "<p>This instruction sets forth the rescue doctrine. As originally developed, the doctrine established a duty of care toward the rescuer and was also the rescuer\u2019s response to the affirmative defense of contributory negligence when contributory negligence was a complete bar to recovery. (See Solgaard v. Guy F. Atkinson Co. (1971) 6 Cal.3d 361, 368 [99 Cal.Rptr. 29, 491 P.2d 821].) Today it may be asserted in much the same way as a response to a claim for comparative fault. (See Neighbarger v. Irwin Industries, Inc. (1994) 8 Cal.4th 532, 536\u2013537 [34 Cal.Rptr.2d 630, 882 P.2d 347] [rescue doctrine discussed in case decided after contributory negligence was no longer a complete bar].)</p><p>The doctrine does not apply if the plaintiff acted rashly or recklessly in attempting the rescue. The defendant has the burden of proving rash or reckless conduct. (Solgaard, supra, 6 Cal.3d at p. 368.)</p><p>One older case has held that the doctrine can apply to a defendant other than one who created the emergency if the defendant negligently increased the plaintiff\u2019s peril. (See Scott v. Texaco, Inc. (1966) 239 Cal.App.2d 431, 435\u2013436 [48 Cal.Rptr.785] [defendant\u2019s vehicle negligently struck plaintiff while she was trying to stop traffic because of an accident up ahead].) Subsequently, the California Supreme Court stated the doctrine as a right to recover from the person whose negligence created the peril. (Solgaard, supra, 6 Cal.3d at p. 368, emphasis added.) However, the negligence of someone other than the one who created the emergency was not at issue in the case, so it is not clear that the court\u2019s language would foreclose such a claim. To use this instruction for such a case, select \u201ca danger to [name of plaintiff]\u201d in element 2. Also omit the bracketed material in the opening sentence.</p>", 
        "sources_and_authority": "<ul><li>\u201cThe cases have developed the rule that persons injured in the course of undertaking a necessary rescue may, absent rash or reckless conduct on their part, recover from the person whose negligence created the peril which necessitated the rescue. [\u00b6] Although its precise limits are not yet fully developed, the rescue doctrine varies the ordinary rules of negligence in two important respects: (1) it permits the rescuer to sue on the basis of defendant\u2019s initial negligence toward the party rescued, without the necessity of proving negligence toward the rescuer, and (2) it substantially restricts the availability of the defense of contributory negligence by requiring defendant to prove that the rescuer acted rashly or recklessly under the circumstances.\u201d (Solgaard, supra, 6 Cal.3d at p. 368, footnote omitted.)</li><li>\u201cThe rescue doctrine contemplates a voluntary act by one who, in an emergency and prompted by spontaneous human motive to save human life, attempts a rescue that he had no duty to attempt by virtue of a legal obligation or duty fastened on him by his employment.\u201d (Bryant v. Glastetter (1995) 32 Cal.App.4th 770, 784 [38 Cal.Rptr.2d 291].)</li><li>\u201c[T]he rescue doctrine arose in an era of contributory negligence, where any negligence on the part of a plaintiff barred the action. \u2018The purpose of the rescue doctrine when it was first created was to avoid having a plaintiff be found contributorily negligent as a matter of law when he voluntarily placed himself in a perilous position to prevent another person from suffering serious injury or death, the courts often stating that the plaintiff\u2019s recovery should not be barred unless his rescue attempt was recklessly or rashly made.\u2019 Most defendants could point to some negligence by the rescuer and simply approaching the danger could be construed as negligent, or as an assumption of the risk. This advanced no tenable public policy: It deterred rescues and ran counter to the human impulse to help others in need. Accordingly, the courts ruled the act of approaching danger did not interrupt the normal causal reach of tort liability and did not, of itself, establish contributory negligence.\u201d (Sears v. Morrison (1999) 76 Cal.App.4th 577, 581 [90 Cal.Rptr.2d 528], internal citations omitted.)</li><li>\u201cIn order to assert the rescue doctrine, the rescuer must show that there was someone in peril and that he acted to rescue such person from the peril.\u201d (Tucker v. CBS Radio Stations, Inc. (2011) 194 Cal.App.4th 1246, 1252 [124 Cal.Rptr.3d 245].)</li><li>\u201cThe evidence in the instant case was uncontradicted that defendant\u2019s employees . . . were in peril of their lives, that immediate action was required to save or assist them, that plaintiff undertook to rescue them, and that he was injured while in the course of doing so. It is apparent, therefore, that plaintiff was, as a matter of law, a rescuer and entitled to the benefits of the rescuer doctrine, including an instruction to the jury that as a rescuer, plaintiff could recover on the basis of defendant\u2019s negligence to [its employees], if plaintiff\u2019s injury was a proximate result thereof, and if plaintiff acted neither rashly nor recklessly under the circumstances.\u201d (Solgaard, supra, 6 Cal.3d at p. 369.)</li><li>\u201cOne also generally owes a duty of care to bystanders who attempt a rescue that becomes necessary due to one\u2019s own negligence. Thus, although it is contributory negligence unreasonably to expose oneself to a risk created by the defendant\u2019s negligence, a person is not contributorily negligent who, with due care, encounters the risk created by the defendant\u2019s negligence in order to perform a rescue necessitated by that negligence.\u201d (Neighbarger, supra, 8 Cal.4th at pp. 536\u2013537, internal citation omitted.)</li><li>\u201cWe do not accept this narrow view of the rescue rule, which would focus attention on the person creating the original danger and not on the person of the rescuer. We think the force of the rule should properly be centered on the rescuer, for it is the quality of his conduct which is being weighed. Whether he was induced to enter a position of danger as a result of the act of a particular defendant or as a result of some outside force is inconsequential to the process of evaluating the quality of his behavior.\u201d (Scott, supra, 239 Cal.App.2d at pp. 435\u2013436.)</li><li>\u201c[Plaintiff] asserts that he should not have been required to show that respondents\u2019 negligence threatened real and imminent harm to himself or others, but only that he reasonably perceived the appearance of such danger . . . . We agree.\u201d (Harris v. Oaks Shopping Ctr. (1999) 70 Cal.App.4th 206, 210 [82 Cal.Rptr.2d 523].)</li><li>\u201cUnder the rescue doctrine, an actor is usually liable for injuries sustained by a rescuer attempting to help another person placed in danger by the actor\u2019s negligent conduct. The question here is whether an actor is liable for injuries sustained by a person who is trying to rescue the actor from his own negligence. The answer is yes.\u201d (Sears, supra, 76 Cal.App.4th at p. 579, original italics.)</li><li>\u201cIn general, the rescue doctrine permits a rescuer to recover for injuries sustained while attempting to rescue a party placed in danger by the defendant\u2019s conduct. In this case we conclude that the rescuer cannot maintain negligence claims against defendant because he failed to establish that a duty of care was owed to the rescued party.\u201d (Tucker, supra, 194 Cal.App.4th at p. 1248.)</li><li>\u201cThere is some disagreement among the authorities where the danger is only to property. In Henshaw v. Belyea (1934) 220 C. 458, 31 P.2d 348, plaintiff ran from a safe place on the sidewalk in an attempt to save his employer\u2019s truck from slipping downhill by placing a block under a wheel, and his foot was crushed. The court approved the extension of the rescue doctrine to such a case. (220 C. 463.) (See 23 Cal. L. Rev. 110; 8 So. Cal. L. Rev. 159.)\u201d (6 Witkin Summary of California Law (10th ed. 2005) Torts, \u00a7 1308.)</li></ul>",

He may \u2018often effectively extend[]\u2019 the limitations period in question \u2018by the filing\u2019 and amendment \u2018of a Doe complaint\u2019 and invocation of the relation-back doctrine. \u2018Where\u2019 he knows the \u2018identity of at least one defendant . . . , [he] must\u2019 proceed thus.\u201d (Norgart, supra, 21 Cal.4th at p. 399, internal citations and footnote omitted.)</li><li>\u201cThe discovery rule only delays accrual until the plaintiff has, or should have, inquiry notice of the cause of action. The discovery rule does not encourage dilatory tactics because plaintiffs are charged with presumptive knowledge of an injury if they have \u2018 \u201c \u2018information of circumstances to put [them] on inquiry\u2019 \u201d \u2019 or if they have \u2018 \u201c \u2018the opportunity to obtain knowledge from sources open to [their] investigation.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 In other words, plaintiffs are required to conduct a reasonable investigation after becoming aware of an injury, and are charged with knowledge of the information that would have been revealed by such an investigation.\u201d (Fox, supra, 35 Cal.4th at pp. 807\u2013808, internal citations omitted.)</li><li>\u201c[I]f continuing injury from a completed act generally extended the limitations periods, those periods would lack meaning. Parties could file suit at any time, as long as their injuries persisted. This is not the law. The time bar starts running when the plaintiff first learns of actionable injury, even if the injury will linger or compound. \u2018 \u201c \u2018[W]here an injury, although slight, is sustained in consequence of the wrongful act of another, and the law affords a remedy therefor, the statute of limitations attaches at once. It is not material that all the damages resulting from the act shall have been sustained at that time, and the running of the statute is not postponed by the fact that the actual or substantial damages do not occur until a later date . . . .\u2019 \u201d \u2019 \u201d (Vaca v.

Apropos to this rule are the following established principles: A person, by his conduct, may be estopped to rely on the statute; where the delay in commencing an action is induced by the conduct of the defendant, it cannot be availed of by him as a defense; one cannot justly or equitably lull his adversary into a false sense of security and thereby cause him to subject his claim to the bar of the statute of limitations, and then be permitted to plead the very delay caused by his conduct as a defense to the action when brought; actual fraud in the technical sense, bad faith or intent to mislead are not essential to the creation of an estoppel, but it is sufficient that the defendant made misrepresentations or so conducted himself that he misled a party, who acted thereon in good faith, to the extent that such party failed to commence the action within the statutory period; a party has a reasonable time in which to bring his action after the estoppel has expired, not exceeding the period of limitation imposed by the statute for commencing the action; and that whether an estoppel exists\u2014whether the acts, representations or conduct lulled a party into a sense of security preventing him from instituting proceedings before the running of the statute, and whether the party relied thereon to his prejudice\u2014is a question of fact and not of law. It is also an established principle that in cases of estoppel to plead the statute of limitations, the same rules are applicable, as in cases falling within subdivision 4 of section 338, in determining when the plaintiff discovered or should have discovered the facts giving rise to his cause of action.\u201d (Estate of Pieper (1964) 224 Cal.App.2d 670, 690\u2013691 [37 Cal.Rptr. 46], internal citations omitted.)</li><li>\u201cAlthough \u2018ignorance of the identity of the defendant . . . will not toll the statute\u2019, \u2018a defendant may be equitably estopped from asserting the statute of limitations when, as the result of intentional concealment, the plaintiff is unable to discover the defendant\u2019s actual identity\u2019.\u201d (Vaca v.

Defendants\u2019 wrongful conduct has given rise to separate causes of action for property damage and personal injury with separate statutes of limitation. Where the plaintiffs reasonably rely on defendants\u2019 promise to repair the property damage without a lawsuit, is a jury permitted to find that plaintiffs\u2019 decision to delay filing a personal injury lawsuit was also reasonable?

        "sources_and_authority": "<ul><li>Code of Civil Procedure section 340.5, which sets the statute of limitations for medical malpractice cases based on professional negligence, and Civil Code sections 3333.1 and 3333.2 define \u201cprofessional negligence\u201d as follows: \u201ca negligent act or omission to act by a health care provider in the rendering of professional services, which act or omission is the proximate cause of a personal injury or wrongful death, provided that such services are within the scope of services for which the provider is licensed and which are not within any restriction imposed by the licensing agency or licensed hospital.\u201d</li><li>\u201cWith respect to professionals, their specialized education and training do not serve to impose an increased duty of care but rather are considered additional \u2018circumstances\u2019 relevant to an overall assessment of what constitutes \u2018ordinary prudence\u2019 in a particular situation.\u201d (Flowers, supra, 8 Cal.4th at pp. 997\u2013998.)</li><li>\u201cSince the standard of care remains constant in terms of \u2018ordinary prudence,\u2019 it is clear that denominating a cause of action as one for \u2018professional negligence\u2019 does not transmute its underlying character. For substantive purposes, it merely serves to establish the basis by which \u2018ordinary prudence\u2019 will be calculated and the defendant\u2019s conduct evaluated.\u201d (Flowers, supra, 8 Cal.4th at p. 998.)</li><li>\u201cThe Medical Injury Compensation Reform Act (MICRA) contains numerous provisions effecting substantial changes in negligence actions against health care providers, including a limitation on noneconomic damages, elimination of the collateral source rule as well as preclusion of subrogation in most instances, and authorization for periodic payments of future damages in excess of $ 50,000. While in each instance the statutory scheme has altered a significant aspect of claims for medical malpractice, such as the measure of the defendant\u2019s liability for damages or the admissibility of evidence, the fundamental substance of such actions on the issues of duty, standard of care, breach, and causation remains unaffected.\u201d (Flowers, supra, 8 Cal.4th at p. 999.)</li><li>\u201cThe law is well settled that in a personal injury action causation must be proven within a reasonable medical probability based upon competent expert testimony. Mere possibility alone is insufficient to establish a prima facie case. . . . That there is a distinction between a reasonable medical \u2018probability\u2019 and a medical \u2018possibility\u2019 needs little discussion. There can be many possible \u2018causes,\u2019 indeed, an infinite number of circumstances which can produce an injury or disease. A possible cause only becomes \u2018probable\u2019 when, in the absence of other reasonable causal explanations, it becomes more likely than not that the injury was a result of its action. This is the outer limit of inference upon which an issue may be submitted to the jury.\u201d (Jennings v. Palomar Pomerado Health Systems, Inc.

When a therapist determines, or pursuant to the standards of his profession should determine, that his patient presents a serious danger of violence to another, he incurs an obligation to use reasonable care to protect the intended victim against such danger. The discharge of this duty may require the therapist to take one or more of various steps, depending upon the nature of the case.

(<i>Thomas v. Intermedics Orthopedics, Inc.</i> (1996) 47 Cal.App.4th 957, 967 [55 Cal.Rptr.2d 197].)</li><li>\u201cThe doctrine has been explained as follows: \u2018A physician generally is not liable for the negligence of hospital or other nurses, attendants, or internes, who are not his employees, particularly where he has no knowledge thereof or no connection therewith. On the other hand, a physician is liable for the negligence of hospital or other nurses, attendants, or internes, who are not his employees, where such negligence is discoverable by him in the exercise of ordinary care, he is negligent in permitting them to attend the patient, or the negligent acts were performed under conditions where, in the exercise of ordinary care, he could have or should have been able to prevent their injurious effects and did not. [\u00b6] The mere fact that a physician or surgeon gives instructions to a hospital employee does not render the physician or surgeon liable for negligence of the hospital employee in carrying out the instructions. Similarly, the mere right of a physician to supervise a hospital employee is not sufficient to render the physician liable for the negligence of such employee. On the other hand, if the physician has the right to exercise control over the work to be done by the hospital employee and the manner of its performance, or an employee of a hospital is temporarily detached in whole or in part from the hospital\u2019s general control so as to become the temporary servant of the physician he assists, the physician will be subject to liability for the employee\u2019s negligence. [\u00b6] Thus, where a hospital employee, although not in the regular employ of an operating surgeon, <i>is under his special supervision and control during the operation</i>, the relationship of master and servant exists, and the surgeon is liable, under the doctrine of respondeat superior, for the employee\u2019s negligence.\u2019 \u201d (<i>Thomas, supra,</i> 47 Cal.App.4th at pp. 966\u2014967, original italics.)</li><li>This doctrine applies only to medical personnel who are actively participating in the surgical procedure.

A helpless patient on the operating table who cannot understand or control what is happening reasonably expects a surgeon to oversee her care and to look out for her interests. We find this special relationship sufficient justification for the continued application of captain of the ship doctrine. Moreover, in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s expressions of approval of the doctrine . . . , we feel compelled to adhere to the doctrine.\u201d (<i>Baumgardner, supra,</i> 144 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1397\u20141398, internal citations omitted.)</li><li>Absent evidence of right to control, an operating surgeon is generally not responsible for the conduct of anesthesiologists or others who independently carry out their duties.

        "sources_and_authority": "<ul><li>Evidence Code section 646(c) provides:<p>If the evidence, or facts otherwise established, would support a res ipsa loquitur presumption and the defendant has introduced evidence which would support a finding that he was not negligent or that any negligence on his part was not a proximate cause of the occurrence, the court may, and upon request shall, instruct the jury to the effect that:</p><div ><p>(1)    If the facts which would give rise to a res ipsa loquitur presumption are found or otherwise established, the jury may draw the inference from such facts that a proximate cause of the occurrence was some negligent conduct on the part of the defendant; and</p><p>(2)    The jury shall not find that a proximate cause of the occurrence was some negligent conduct on the part of the defendant unless the jury believes, after weighing all the evidence in the case and drawing such inferences therefrom as the jury believes are warranted, that it is more probable than not that the occurrence was caused by some negligent conduct on the part of the defendant.</p></div></li><li>Evidence Code section 604 provides: \u201cThe effect of a presumption affecting the burden of producing evidence is to require the trier of fact to assume the existence of the presumed fact unless and until evidence is introduced which would support a finding of its nonexistence, in which case the trier of fact shall determine the existence or nonexistence of the presumed fact from the evidence and without regard to the presumption. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent the drawing of any inference that may be appropriate.\u201d</li><li>\u201cIn California, the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur is defined by statute as \u2018a presumption affecting the burden of producing evidence.\u2019 The presumption arises when the evidence satisfies three conditions: \u2018 \u201c(1) the accident must be of a kind which ordinarily does not occur in the absence of someone\u2019s negligence; (2) it must be caused by an agency or instrumentality within the exclusive control of the defendant; (3) it must not have been due to any voluntary action or contribution on the part of the plaintiff.\u201d \u2019 A presumption affecting the burden of producing evidence \u2018require[s] the trier of fact to assume the existence of the presumed fact\u2019 unless the defendant introduces evidence to the contrary. The presumed fact, in this context, is that \u2018a proximate cause of the occurrence was some negligent conduct on the part of the defendant. . . .\u2019 If the defendant introduces \u2018evidence which would support a finding that he was not negligent or that any negligence on his part was not a proximate cause of the occurrence,\u2019 the trier of fact determines whether defendant was negligent without regard to the presumption, simply by weighing the evidence.\u201d (Brown v. Poway Unified School Dist. (1993) 4 Cal.4th 820, 825\u2013826 [15 Cal.Rptr.2d 679, 843 P.2d 624], internal citations omitted.)</li><li>\u201c \u2018The doctrine of res ipsa loquitur is applicable where the accident is of such a nature that it can be said, in the light of past experience, that it probably was the result of negligence by someone and that the defendant is probably the one responsible.\u2019 \u201d (Howe, supra, 189 Cal.App.4th at p. 1161.)</li><li>\u201cRes ipsa loquitur is an evidentiary rule for \u2018determining whether circumstantial evidence of negligence is sufficient.\u2019 \u201d (Howe, supra, 189 Cal.App.4th at p. 1161, internal citation omitted.)</li><li>The doctrine \u201cis based on a theory of \u2018probability\u2019 where there is no direct evidence of defendant\u2019s conduct, permitting a common sense inference of negligence from the happening of the accident.\u201d (Gicking v. Kimberlin (1985) 170 Cal.App.3d 73, 75 [215 Cal.Rptr. 834].)</li><li>\u201cAll of the cases hold, in effect, that it must appear, either as a matter of common experience or from evidence in the case, that the accident is of a type which probably would not happen unless someone was negligent.\u201d (Zentz v. Coca Cola Bottling Co. of Fresno (1952) 39 Cal.2d 436, 442\u2013443 [247 P.2d 344].)</li><li>\u201cIn determining the applicability of res ipsa loquitur, courts have relied on both expert testimony and common knowledge. The standard of care in a professional negligence case can be proved only by expert testimony unless the conduct required by the particular circumstances is within the common knowledge of the layperson.\u201d (Blackwell v. Hurst (1996) 46 Cal.App.4th 939, 943 [54 Cal.Rptr.2d 209], internal citations omitted.)</li><li>\u201cUnder the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur and this common knowledge exception, it is proper to instruct the jury that it can infer negligence from the happening of the accident itself, if it finds based on common knowledge, the testimony of physicians called as expert witnesses, and all the circumstances, that the injury was more likely than not the result of negligence.\u201d (Gannon v. Elliot (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 1, 6 [23 Cal.Rptr.2d 86], internal citation omitted.)</li><li>\u201cThe fact that a particular injury rarely occurs does not in itself justify an inference of negligence unless some other evidence indicates negligence. To justify res ipsa loquitur instructions, appellant must have produced sufficient evidence to permit the jury to make the necessary decision. He must have presented \u2018some substantial evidence which, if believed by the jury, would entitle it to draw an inference of negligence from the happening of the accident itself.\u2019 \u201d (Blackwell, supra, 46 Cal.App.4th at p. 944, internal citations omitted.)</li><li>The purpose of the second \u201ccontrol\u201d requirement is to \u201clink the defendant with the probability, already established, that the accident was negligently caused.\u201d (Newing v. Cheatham (1975) 15 Cal.3d 351, 362 [124 Cal.Rptr. 193, 540 P.2d 33].) The control requirement is not absolute. (Zentz, supra, 39 Cal.2d at p. 443.)</li><li>\u201cThe purpose of [the third] requirement, like that of control by the defendant is to establish that the defendant is the one probably responsible for the accident. The plaintiff need not show that he was entirely inactive at the time of the accident in order to satisfy this requirement, so long as the evidence is such as to eliminate his conduct as a factor contributing to the occurrence.\u201d (Newing, supra, 15 Cal.3d at p. 363, internal citations omitted.)</li><li>The third condition \u201cshould not be confused with the problem of contributory negligence, as to which defendant has the burden of proof. . . . [I]ts purpose, like that of control by the defendant, is merely to assist the court in determining whether it is more probable than not that the defendant was responsible for the accident.\u201d (Zentz, supra, 39 Cal.2d at p. 444.)</li><li>\u201c[Evidence Code section 646] . . . classified the doctrine as a presumption affecting the burden of producing evidence. Under that classification, when the predicate facts are established to give rise to the presumption, the burden of producing evidence to rebut it shifts to the defendant to prove lack of negligence or lack of proximate cause that the injury claimed was the result of that negligence. As a presumption affecting the burden of producing evidence (as distinguished from a presumption affecting the burden of proof), if evidence is presented to rebut the presumed fact, the presumption is out of the case\u2014it \u2018disappears.\u2019 But if no such evidence is submitted, the trier of fact must find the presumed fact to be established.\u201d (Howe, supra, 189 Cal.App.4th at p. 1162.)</li><li>\u201c \u2018If evidence is produced that would support a finding that the defendant was not negligent or that any negligence on his part was not a proximate cause of the accident, the presumptive effect of the doctrine vanishes.\u2019 \u2018[T]he mere introduction of evidence sufficient to sustain a finding of the nonexistence of the presumed fact causes the presumption, as a matter of law, to disappear.\u2019 When the presumptive effect vanishes, it is the plaintiff\u2019s burden to introduce actual evidence that would show that the defendant is negligent and that such negligence was the proximate cause of the accident.\u201d (Howe, supra, 189 Cal.App.4th at p. 1163, internal citations omitted.)</li><li>\u201cAs the [Law Revision Commission] Comment [to Evidence Code section 646] explains, even though the presumptive effect of the doctrine vanishes, \u2018the jury may still be able to draw an inference that the accident was caused by the defendant\u2019s lack of due care from the facts that gave rise to the presumption. . . . [\u00b6]  . . .  [\u00b6] . . . An inference of negligence may well be warranted from all of the evidence in the case even though the plaintiff fails to establish all the elements of res ipsa loquitur. In appropriate cases, therefore, the jury may be instructed that, even though it does not find that the facts giving rise to the presumption have been proved by a preponderance of the evidence, it may nevertheless find the defendant negligent if it concludes from a consideration of all the evidence that it is more probable than not that the defendant was negligent.\u2019 \u201d (Howe, supra, 189 Cal.App.4th at p. 1163, internal citation omitted.)</li><li>\u201cIt follows that where part of the facts basic to the application of the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur is established as a matter of law but that others are not, the court should instruct that application of the doctrine by the jury depends only upon the existence of the basic facts not conclusively established.\u201d (Rimmele v. Northridge Hosp. Foundation (1975) 46 Cal.App.3d 123, 130 [120 Cal.Rptr. 39].)</li></ul>",

Like tolling the statute of limitations for confined prisoners under section 352.1, tolling under section 351 for a defendant\u2019s absence from California is of general applicability [and therefore extends the one-year period of Code of Civil Procedure section 340.5].

When the Legislature added the separate statute of limitations for minors to section 340.5 in 1975, it clearly intended that the general provision for</li>tolling of statutes of limitation during a person\u2019s minority (\u00a7 352, subd.

First, the plaintiff must file within one year after she first \u2018discovers\u2019 the injury and the negligent cause of that injury. Secondly, she must file within three years after she first experiences harm from the injury. This means that if a plaintiff does not \u2018discover\u2019 the negligent cause of her injury until more than three years after she first experiences harm from the injury, she will not be able to bring a malpractice action against the medical practitioner or hospital whose malpractice caused her injury.\u201d (Ashworth v.

Proc., \u00a7 364] is best effectuated by construing section 364(d) as tolling the one-year statute of limitations when section 364(a)\u2019s ninety-day notice of intent to sue is served during, but not before, the last ninety days of the one-year limitations period. Because the statute of limitations is tolled for 90 days and not merely extended by 90 days from the date of service of the notice, this construction results in a period of 1 year and 90 days in which to file the lawsuit. In providing for a waiting period of at least 90 days before suit can be brought, this construction achieves the legislative objective of encouraging negotiated resolutions of disputes.\u201d (Woods, supra, 53 Cal.3d at p. 325.)</li></ul>",

While proof of the government\u2019s inability to prove guilt may involve technical defenses and evidentiary rules, proof of actual innocence obliges the malpractice plaintiff \u2018to convince the civil jurors of his innocence.\u2019 Thus, the determination of actual innocence is rooted in the goal of reliable factfinding.\u201d (Salisbury v.

[P]ublic policy considerations require that only an innocent person wrongly convicted be deemed to have suffered a legally compensable harm. Unless a person convicted of a criminal offense is successful in obtaining postconviction relief, the policies reviewed in Wiley [supra] preclude recovery in a legal malpractice action.\u201d (Coscia, supra, 25 Cal.4th at p. 1201.)</li><li>\u201c[A] plaintiff must obtain postconviction relief in the form of a final disposition of the underlying criminal case\u2014for example, by acquittal after retrial, reversal on appeal with directions to dismiss the charges, reversal followed by the People\u2019s refusal to continue the prosecution, or a grant of habeas corpus relief\u2014as a prerequisite to proving actual innocence in a malpractice action against former criminal defense counsel.\u201d (Coscia, supra, 25 Cal.4th at p. 1205.)</li><li>\u201c[T]he rationale of Wiley and Coscia requires a plaintiff in a criminal legal malpractice case to show actual innocence and postconviction exoneration on any guilty finding for a lesser included offense, even though the plaintiff alleges he received negligent representation only on the greater offense.\u201d (Sangha v.

The plaintiff\u2019s ignorance of the cause of action, or of the identity of the wrongdoer, does not toll the statute. In cases of professional malpractice, however, postponement of the period of limitations until discovery finds justification in the special nature of the relationship between the professional man and his client.\u201d (Neel v. Magana, Olney, Levy, Cathcart &amp; Gelfand (1971) 6 Cal.3d 176, 187\u2013188 [98 Cal.Rptr. 837, 491 P.2d 421], footnote omitted.)</li><li>\u201cWe hold that a cause of action for legal malpractice does not accrue until the client discovers, or should discover, the facts establishing the elements of his cause of action.\u201d (Neel, supra, 6 Cal.3d at p. 194.)</li><li>\u201cIf the allegedly negligent conduct does not cause damage, it generates no cause of action in tort. The mere breach of a professional duty, causing only nominal damages, speculative harm, or the threat of future harm\u2014not yet realized\u2014does not suffice to create a cause of action for negligence. Hence, until the client suffers appreciable harm as a consequence of his attorney\u2019s negligence, the client cannot establish a cause of action for malpractice.\u201d (Budd v. Nixen (1971) 6 Cal.3d 195, 200 [98 Cal.Rptr. 849, 491 P.2d 433], internal citations omitted.)</li><li>\u201cThe mere existence of an attorney-client relationship does not trigger the continuous representation rule: \u2018Instead, the statute\u2019s tolling language addresses a particular phase of such a relationship-representation regarding a specific subject matter. Moreover, the limitations period is not tolled when an attorney\u2019s subsequent role is only tangentially related to the legal representation the attorney provided to the plaintiff. Therefore, \u201c[t]he inquiry is not whether an attorney-client relationship still exists but when the representation of the specific matter terminated.\u201d \u2019 Tolling does not apply where there is a continuing relationship between the attorney and client \u2018involving only unrelated matters.\u2019 \u201d (Lockton v.

[\u00b6] That either an attorney or a firm may be the subject of an action does not support a reading under which representation by one attorney or firm might toll the limitations period as to another no longer affiliated attorney or firm. Rather, the text implies an action against a law firm is tolled so long as that firm continues representation, just as an action against an attorney is tolled so long as that attorney continues representation, but representation by one attorney or firm does not toll claims that may exist against a different, unaffiliated attorney or firm.\u201d (Beal Bank, SSB v.

That may occur upon the attorney\u2019s express notification to the client that the attorney will perform no further services, or, if the attorney remains silent, may be inferred from the circumstances. Absent actual notice to the client that the attorney will perform no further legal services or circumstances that reasonably should cause the client to so conclude, a client should be entitled to rely on an attorney to perform the agreed services and should not be required to interrupt the attorney- client relationship by filing a malpractice complaint. After a client has no reasonable expectation that the attorney will provide further legal services, however, the client is no longer hindered by a potential disruption of the attorney-client relationship and no longer relies on the attorney\u2019s continuing representation, so the tolling should end. To this extent and for these reasons, we conclude that continuous representation should be viewed objectively from the client\u2019s perspective . . . .\u201d (Laclette v.

Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher LLP (2011) 194 Cal.App.4th 557, 576 [125 Cal.Rptr.3d 120].)</li><li>\u201c[P]rior to the enactment of section 340.6 the running of the statute of limitations coincided with accrual of the plaintiff\u2019s malpractice cause of action, including damages. By contrast, under the provisions of section 340.6, discovery of the negligent act or omission initiates the statutory period, and the absence of injury or damages serves as a tolling factor.\u201d (Adams v. Paul (1995) 11 Cal.4th 583, 598 fn. 2 [46 Cal.Rptr.2d 594, 904 P.2d 1205], internal citations omitted.)</li><li>\u201c[A] defendant must prove the facts necessary to enjoy the benefit of a statute of limitations.\u201d (Samuels v. Mix (1999) 22 Cal.4th 1, 10 [91 Cal.Rptr.2d 273, 989 P.2d 701], internal citations omitted.)</li><li>\u201cIn ordinary tort and contract actions, the statute of limitations, it is true, begins to run upon the occurrence of the last element essential to the cause of action. The plaintiff\u2019s ignorance of the cause of action, or of the identity of the wrongdoer, does not toll the statute. In cases of professional malpractice, however, postponement of the period of limitations until discovery finds justification in the special nature of the relationship between the professional man and his client.\u201d (Neel v. Magana, Olney, Levy, Cathcart &amp; Gelfand (1971) 6 Cal.3d 176, 187\u2013188 [98 Cal.Rptr. 837, 491 P.2d 421], footnote omitted.)</li><li>\u201cIf the allegedly negligent conduct does not cause damage, it generates no cause of action in tort. The mere breach of a professional duty, causing only nominal damages, speculative harm, or the threat of future harm\u2014not yet realized\u2014does not suffice to create a cause of action for negligence. Hence, until the client suffers appreciable harm as a consequence of his attorney\u2019s negligence, the client cannot establish a cause of action for malpractice.\u201d (Budd v. Nixen (1971) 6 Cal.3d 195, 200 [98 Cal.Rptr. 849, 491 P.2d 433], internal citations omitted.)</li><li>\u201cThe mere existence of an attorney-client relationship does not trigger the continuous representation rule: \u2018Instead, the statute\u2019s tolling language addresses a particular phase of such a relationship-representation regarding a specific subject matter. Moreover, the limitations period is not tolled when an attorney\u2019s subsequent role is only tangentially related to the legal representation the attorney provided to the plaintiff. Therefore, \u201c[t]he inquiry is not whether an attorney-client relationship still exists but when the representation of the specific matter terminated.\u201d \u2019 Tolling does not apply where there is a continuing relationship between the attorney and client \u2018involving only unrelated matters.\u2019 \u201d (Lockton v. O\u2019Rourke (2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 1051, 1064 [109 Cal.Rptr.3d 392], original italics, internal citations omitted.)</li><li>\u201c[W]here a client hires a law firm to represent it, the provisions of section 340.6 apply to that firm; the term \u2018attorney\u2019 in section 340.6 may embrace the entire partnership, law corporation, or other legal entity the client retains. [\u00b6] That either an attorney or a firm may be the subject of an action does not support a reading under which representation by one attorney or firm might toll the limitations period as to another no longer affiliated attorney or firm. Rather, the text implies an action against a law firm is tolled so long as that firm continues representation, just as an action against an attorney is tolled so long as that attorney continues representation, but representation by one attorney or firm does not toll claims that may exist against a different, unaffiliated attorney or firm.\u201d (Beal Bank, SSB v. Arter &amp; Hadden, LLP (2007) 42 Cal.4th 503, 509 [66 Cal.Rptr.3d 52, 167 P.3d 666], original italics.)</li><li>\u201c \u2018Ordinarily, an attorney\u2019s representation is not completed until the agreed tasks or events have occurred, the client consents to termination or a court grants an application by counsel for withdrawal.\u2019 \u2018The rule is that, for purposes of the statute of limitations, the attorney\u2019s representation is concluded when the parties so agree, and that result does not depend upon formal termination, such as withdrawing as counsel of record.\u2019 \u2018Continuity of representation ultimately depends, not on the client\u2019s subjective beliefs, but rather on evidence of an ongoing mutual relationship and of activities in furtherance of the relationship.\u2019 \u201d (Nielsen v. Beck (2007) 157 Cal.App.4th 1041, 1049 [69 Cal.Rptr.3d 435], internal citations omitted.)</li><li>\u201c[A]bsent a statutory standard to determine when an attorney\u2019s representation of a client regarding a specific subject matter ends, and consistent with the purposes of the continuing representation rule, we conclude that for purposes of . . . section 340.6, subdivision (a)(2), in the event of an attorney\u2019s unilateral withdrawal or abandonment of the client, the representation ends when the client actually has or reasonably should have no expectation that the attorney will provide further legal services. . . . That may occur upon the attorney\u2019s express notification to the client that the attorney will perform no further services, or, if the attorney remains silent, may be inferred from the circumstances. Absent actual notice to the client that the attorney will perform no further legal services or circumstances that reasonably should cause the client to so conclude, a client should be entitled to rely on an attorney to perform the agreed services and should not be required to interrupt the attorney- client relationship by filing a malpractice complaint. After a client has no reasonable expectation that the attorney will provide further legal services, however, the client is no longer hindered by a potential disruption of the attorney-client relationship and no longer relies on the attorney\u2019s continuing representation, so the tolling should end. To this extent and for these reasons, we conclude that continuous representation should be viewed objectively from the client\u2019s perspective . . . .\u201d (Laclette v.

Hartnett (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 669, 675\u2013676 [23 Cal.Rptr.2d 567].)</li><li>\u201c[U]nless the evidence points to one conclusion only, the question of the existence of the requisite permission under [section 17150] is one to be determined by the trier of fact, \u2018upon the facts and circumstances in evidence and the inferences reasonably to be drawn therefrom.\u2019 \u201d (Peterson v. Grieger, Inc. (1961) 57 Cal.2d 43, 51 [17 Cal.Rptr. 828, 367 P.2d 420], internal citations omitted.)</li><li>\u201c[P]ermission cannot be left to speculation or conjecture nor be assumed, but must be affirmatively proved, and the fact of permission is just as important to sustain the imposition of liability as is the fact of ownership.\u201d (Scheff v. Roberts (1950) 35 Cal.2d 10, 12 [215 P.2d 925], internal citations omitted.)</li><li>\u201cWhere the issue of implied permissive use is involved, the general relationship existing between the owner and the operator, is of paramount importance. Where, for example, the parties are related by blood, or marriage, or where the relationship between the owner and the operator is that of principal and agent, weaker direct evidence will support a finding of such use than where the parties are only acquaintances or strangers.\u201d (Elkinton v. California State Automobile Assn., Interstate Insurance Bureau (1959) 173 Cal.App.2d 338, 344 [343 P.2d 396], internal citations omitted.)</li><li>\u201cThere is no doubt that the word \u2018owner\u2019 as used in [the predecessor to Vehicle Code section 17150] for the purpose of creating a liability thereunder, is not synonymous with that word as used in the ordinary sense of referring to a person or persons whose title is good as against all others. Under the Vehicle Code there may be several such \u2018owners\u2019 at any one time. One or more persons may be an \u2018owner,\u2019 and thus liable for the injuries of a third party, even though no such \u2018owner\u2019 possesses all of the normal incidents of ownership.\u201d (Stoddart v. Peirce (1959) 53 Cal.2d 105, 115 [346 P.2d 774], internal citation omitted.)</li><li>\u201cThe question whether the [defendant] was an owner for purposes of imposition of liability for negligence [under Vehicle Code section 17150] was one of fact.\u201d (Campbell v. Security Pacific Nat. Bank (1976) 62 Cal.App.3d 379, 385 [133 Cal.Rptr. 77].)</li><li>\u201cStrict compliance with Vehicle Code section 5602 [regarding the sale or transfer of a vehicle] is required to enable a transferring owner to escape the liability imposed by section 17150 on account of an accident occurring before notice of the transfer is received by the Motor Vehicle Department.\u201d (Laureano v. Christensen (1971) 18 Cal.App.3d 515, 520\u2013521 [95 Cal.Rptr. 872].)</li><li>\u201c[T]he true and actual owner of an automobile [is not] relieved from liability by the expedient of registration in the name of another. . . . It is clear that it was the legislative intent to make the actual owners of automobiles liable for the negligence of those to whom permission is given to drive them. According to the allegations of the complaint defendants . . . were in fact the true owners of the car and had control of it, the registration being in the name of defendant [driver] for the purpose of avoiding liability.\u201d (McCalla v. Grosse (1941) 42 Cal.App.2d 546, 549\u2013550 [109 P.2d 358].)</li><li>\u201c[I]t is a question of fact in cases of co-ownership, as it is in cases of single ownership, whether the operation of an automobile is with or without the consent, express or implied, of an owner who is not personally participating in such operation. The mere fact of co-ownership does not necessarily or conclusively establish that the common owners have consented to any usage or possession among themselves of a type for which permission is essential.\u201d (Krum v. Malloy (1943) 22 Cal.2d 132, 136 [137 P.2d 18].)</li><li>\u201cThe immunity of the negligent operator under the [Workers\u2019 Compensation] Act does not insulate a vehicle owner who is neither the plaintiff\u2019s employer nor co-employee from liability under section 17150. [\u00b6] Since the owner\u2019s liability does not arise from the status or liability of the operator, the defenses applicable to the operator are not available to the owner.\u201d (Galvis v. Petito (1993) 13 Cal.App.4th 551, 554 [16 Cal.Rptr.2d 560].)</li><li>\u201cThe doctrine of \u2018negligent entrustment\u2019 is clearly distinguishable from the theory of \u2018vicarious liability.\u2019 Negligent entrustment is a common law liability doctrine. Conversely, the obligation of a lending owner of an automobile is one of statutory liability. An owner of an automobile may be independently negligent in entrusting it to an incompetent driver. California is one of several states which recognizes the liability of an automobile owner who has entrusted a car to an incompetent, reckless, or inexperienced driver, and has supplemented the common law doctrine of negligent entrustment by enactment of a specific consent statute.\u201d (Syah v. Johnson (1966) 247 Cal.App.2d 534, 538 [55 Cal.Rptr. 741], internal citations omitted.)</li><li>For purposes of liability under the permissive use statute, \u201c[s]ince defendant [car owner] had the opportunity of making such investigation as he deemed necessary to satisfy himself as to the identity of the [renter] to whom he intrusted his automobile, he should not be permitted to escape liability to a third party because of any fraudulent misrepresentation made by the renter of the car to him.\u201d (Tuderios v. Hertz Drivurself Stations, Inc. (1945) 70 Cal.App.2d 192, 198 [160 P.2d 554].)</li><li>\u201c[T]he provisions of Proposition 51 do not operate to reduce the liability of vehicle owners imposed by Vehicle Code section 17150.\u201d (Rashtian v. BRAC- BH, Inc. (1992) 9 Cal.App.4th 1847, 1849 [12 Cal.Rptr.2d 411].)</li><li>\u201c[I]f the evidence shows that an automobile was being driven by an employee of the owner at the time of an accident, the jury may infer that the employee was operating the automobile with the permission of the owner.\u201d (Hicks v. Reis (1943) 21 Cal.2d 654, 659 [134 P.2d 788], internal quotation marks and citations omitted.)</li><li>\u201cThe mere fact that at the time of an accident one is driving an automobile belonging to another is not, of itself, sufficient to establish that the former was driving the car with the permission of the owner.\u201d (Di Rebaylio v. Herndon (1935) 6 Cal.App.2d 567, 569 [44 P.2d 581].)</li><li>\u201c[I]mplied permission to use an automobile may be found even where the owner and permittee expressly deny that permission was given.\u201d (Anderson v. Wagnon (1952) 110 Cal.App.2d 362, 366 [242 P.2d 915].)</li><li>\u201c[I]n determining whether there has been an implied permission, it is not necessary that the owner have prior knowledge that the driver intends to use the car, but it must be \u2018under circumstances from which consent to use the car is necessarily implied.\u2019 \u201d (Mucci v. Winter (1951) 103 Cal.App.2d 627, 631 [230 P.2d 22], internal citation omitted.)</li><li>For purposes of statutory vicarious liability, \u201cif the owner entrusts his car to another he invests him with the same authority to select an operator which the owner has in the first instance. . . . [\u00b6] . . . The owner is thus liable for negligent acts by a subpermittee even though the subpermittee operated the owner\u2019s vehicle with authorization only from the permittee, since the foundation of the statutory liability is the permission given to another to use an instrumentality which if improperly used is a danger and menace to the public.\u201d (Peterson v. Grieger, Inc. (1961) 57 Cal.2d 43, 54 [17 Cal.Rptr. 828, 367 P.2d 420], internal quotation marks and citations omitted.)</li></ul>",

In determining whether defendant was negligent in entrusting its car to [the driver], defendant\u2019s conduct is to be measured by what an ordinarily prudent person would do in similar circumstances.\u201d (Osborn v. Hertz Corp. (1988) 205 Cal.App.3d 703, 709 [252 Cal.Rptr. 613], internal citations omitted.)</li><li>\u201cLiability for negligent entrustment is determined by applying general principles of negligence, and ordinarily it is for the jury to determine whether the owner has exercised the required degree of care.\u201d (Allen v. Toledo (1980) 109 Cal.App.3d 415, 421 [167 Cal.Rptr. 270], internal citations omitted.)</li><li>\u201cA claim that an employer was negligent in hiring or retaining an employee- driver rarely differs in substance from a claim that an employer was negligent in entrusting a vehicle to the employee. Awareness, constructive or actual, that a person is unfit or incompetent to drive underlies a claim that an employer was negligent in hiring or retaining that person as a driver. (See Judicial Council of Cal. Civ. Jury Instns. (2011) CACI No. 426.) That same awareness underlies a claim for negligent entrustment. (See CACI No. 724.) In a typical case, like this, the two claims are functionally identical.\u201d (Diaz v. Carcamo (2011) 51 Cal.4th 1148, 1157 [126 Cal.Rptr.3d 443, 253 P.3d 535].)</li><li>\u201c[I]f an employer admits vicarious liability for its employee\u2019s negligent driving in the scope of employment, \u2018the damages attributable to both employer and employee will be coextensive.\u2019 Thus, when a plaintiff alleges a negligent entrustment or hiring cause of action against the employer and the employer admits vicarious liability for its employee\u2019s negligent driving, the universe of defendants who can be held responsible for plaintiff\u2019s damages is reduced by one\u2014the employer\u2014for purposes of apportioning fault under Proposition 51. Consequently, the employer would not be mentioned on the special verdict form. The jury must divide fault for the accident among the listed tortfeasors, and the employer is liable only for whatever share of fault the jury assigns to the employee.\u201d (Diaz, supra, 41 Cal.4th at p. 1159, internal citation omitted.)</li><li>\u201c[O]rdinarily, in the absence of a special relationship between the parties, there is no duty to control the conduct of a third person so as to prevent him from causing harm to another and . . . this rule applies even where the third person\u2019s conduct is made possible only because the defendant has relinquished control of his property to the third person, unless the defendant has reason to believe that the third person is incompetent to manage it.\u201d (Grafton v. Mollica (1965) 231 Cal.App.2d 860, 863 [42 Cal.Rptr. 306].)</li><li>\u201c[T]he tort requires demonstration of actual knowledge of facts showing or suggesting the driver\u2019s incompetence\u2014not merely his lack of a license. . . . For liability to exist, knowledge must be shown of the user\u2019s incompetence or inability safely to use the [vehicle].\u201d (Dodge Center v. Superior Court (1988) 199 Cal.App.3d 332, 341 [244 Cal.Rptr. 789], internal citations omitted.)</li><li>\u201cKnowledge of possession of a temporary permit allowing a person to drive only if accompanied by a licensed driver is sufficient to put the entrustor \u2018upon inquiry as to the competency of\u2019 the unlicensed driver. . . . It is then for the jury to determine under the circumstances whether the entrustor is negligent in permitting the unlicensed driver to operate the vehicle.\u201d (Nault v. Smith (1961) 194 Cal.App.2d 257, 267\u2013268 [14 Cal.Rptr. 889], internal citations omitted.)</li><li>\u201c[E]ntrustment of a vehicle to an intoxicated person is not negligence per se. A plaintiff must prove defendant had knowledge of plaintiff\u2019s incompetence when entrusting the vehicle.\u201d (Blake v. Moore (1984) 162 Cal.App.3d 700, 706 [208 Cal.Rptr. 703].)</li><li>\u201c[T]he mere sale of an automobile to an unlicensed and inexperienced person does not constitute negligence per se.\u201d (Perez v. G &amp; W Chevrolet, Inc. (1969) 274 Cal.App.2d 766, 768 [79 Cal.Rptr. 287].)</li><li>\u201cIt is well-settled that where a company knows that an employee has no operator\u2019s license that such knowledge is sufficient to put the employer on inquiry as to his competency; it is for the jury to determine under such circumstances whether the employer was negligent in permitting the employee to drive a vehicle.\u201d (Syah v. Johnson (1966) 247 Cal.App.2d 534, 545 [55 Cal.Rptr. 741].)</li><li>\u201c[I]t has generally been held that the owner of an automobile is under no duty to persons who may be injured by its use to keep it out of the hands of a third person in the absence of facts putting the owner on notice that the third person is incompetent to handle it.\u201d (Richards v. Stanley (1954) 43 Cal.2d 60, 63 [271 P.2d 23], internal citations omitted.)</li><li>\u201c[T]he mere fact of co-ownership does not prevent one co-owner from controlling use of the vehicle by the other co-owner. Thus, where . . . plaintiff alleges that one co-owner had power over the use of the vehicle by the other and that the negligent co-owner drove with the express or implied consent of such controlling co-owner, who knew of the driver\u2019s incompetence, the basis for a cause of action for negligent entrustment has been stated.\u201d (Mettelka v.

Christian (1968) 69 Cal.2d 108, 119 [70 Cal.Rptr. 97, 443 P.2d 561].)</li><li>\u201cIt is well settled that a property owner is not liable for damages caused by a minor, trivial, or insignificant defect in his property. This principle is sometimes referred to as the \u2018trivial defect defense,\u2019 although it is not an affirmative defense but rather an aspect of duty that a plaintiff must plead and prove. . . . Moreover, what constitutes a minor defect may be a question of law.\u201d (Cadam v. Somerset Gardens Townhouse HOA (2011) 200 Cal.App.4th 383, 388\u2013389 [132 Cal.Rptr.3d 617], internal citations omitted.)</li><li>In this state, duties are no longer imposed on an occupier of land solely on the basis of rigid classifications of trespasser, licensee, and invitee. The purpose of plaintiff\u2019s presence on the land is not determinative. We have recognized, however, that this purpose may have some bearing upon the liability issue. This purpose therefore must be considered along with other factors weighing for and against the imposition of a duty on the landowner.\u201d (Ann M., supra, 6 Cal.4th at pp. 674\u2013675, internal citations omitted.)</li><li>\u201cAs stated in Beauchamp v. Los Gatos Golf Course (1969) 273 Cal.App.2d 20, 25 [77 Cal.Rptr. 914], \u2018[t]he term \u201cinvitee\u201d has not been abandoned, nor have \u201ctrespasser\u201d and \u201clicensee.\u201d In the minds of the jury, whether a possessor of the premises has acted as a reasonable man toward a plaintiff, in view of the probability of injury to him, will tend to involve the circumstances under which he came upon defendant\u2019s land; and the probability of exposure of plaintiff and others of his class to the risk of injury; as well as whether the condition itself presented an unreasonable risk of harm, in view of the foreseeable use of the property.\u2019 Thus, the court concluded, and we agree, Rowland \u2018does not generally abrogate the decisions declaring the substantive duties of the possessor of land to invitees nor those establishing the correlative rights and duties of invitees.\u2019 (Id., at p. 27.)\u201d (Williams v. Carl Karcher Enterprises, Inc. (1986) 182 Cal.App.3d 479, 486\u2013487 [227 Cal.Rptr. 465], overruled on other grounds in Soule v. GM Corp.

The question is whether in the management of his property, the possessor of land has acted as a reasonable person under all the circumstances. The likelihood of injury to plaintiff, the probable seriousness of such injury, the burden of reducing or avoiding the risk, the location of the land, and the possessor\u2019s degree of control over the risk-creating condition are among the factors to be considered by the trier of fact in evaluating the reasonableness of a defendant\u2019s conduct.\u201d (Sprecher, supra, 30 Cal.3d at p. 372.)</li><li>\u201cA landowner\u2019s duty of care to avoid exposing others to a risk of injury is not limited to injuries that occur on premises owned or controlled by the landowner. Rather, the duty of care encompasses a duty to avoid exposing persons to risks of injury that occur off-site if the landowner\u2019s property is maintained in such a manner as to expose persons to an unreasonable risk of injury off-site.\u201d (Barnes v. Black (1999) 71 Cal.App.4th 1473, 1478\u20131479 [84 Cal.Rptr.2d 634], internal citations omitted.)</li><li>\u201cThe duty which a possessor of land owes to others to put and maintain it in reasonably safe condition is nondelegable. If an independent contractor, no matter how carefully selected, is employed to perform it, the possessor is answerable for harm caused by the negligent failure of his contractor to put or maintain the buildings and structures in reasonably safe condition, irrespective of whether the contractor\u2019s negligence lies in his incompetence, carelessness, inattention or delay.\u201d (Brown, supra, 23 Cal.2d at p. 260.)</li></ul>",

Whether or not a guest has a right to expect that his host will remedy dangerous conditions on his account, he should reasonably be entitled to rely upon a warning of the dangerous condition so that he, like the host, will be in a position to take special precautions when he comes in contact with it.\u201d (Rowland v.

Under such circumstances knowledge thereof is imputed to him. Where the dangerous condition is brought about by natural wear and tear, or third persons, or acts of God or by other causes which are not due to the negligence of the owner, or his employees, then to impose liability the owner must have either actual or constructive knowledge of the dangerous condition or have been able by the exercise of ordinary care to discover the condition, which if known to him, he should realize as involving an unreasonable risk to invitees on his premises. His negligence in such cases is founded upon his failure to exercise ordinary care in remedying the defect after he has discovered it or as a man of ordinary prudence should have discovered it.\u201d (Hatfield v. Levy Bros.

In the ordinary slip-and-fall case, . . . the cause of the dangerous condition is not necessarily linked to an employee. Consequently, there is no issue of respondeat superior. Where, however, \u2018the evidence is such that a reasonable inference can be drawn that the condition was created by employees of the [defendant], then [the defendant] is charged with notice of the dangerous condition.\u2019 \u201d (Getchell v.

Moreover, it would not be prudent to hold otherwise. Without this knowledge requirement, certain store owners would essentially incur strict liability for slip- and-fall injuries, i.e., they would be insurers of the safety of their patrons. For example, whether the french fry was dropped 10 seconds or 10 hours before the accident would be of no consequence to the liability finding. However, this is not to say that a store owner\u2019s business choices do not impact the negligence analysis. If the store owner\u2019s practices create a higher risk that dangerous conditions will exist, ordinary care will require a corresponding increase in precautions.\u201d (Moore v.

        "sources_and_authority": "<ul><li>\u201cA landlord owes a duty of care to a tenant to provide and maintain safe conditions on the leased premises. This duty of care also extends to the general public. \u2018A lessor who leases property for a purpose involving the admission of the public is under a duty to see that it is safe for the purposes intended, and to exercise reasonable care to inspect and repair the premises before possession is transferred so as to prevent any unreasonable risk of harm to the public who may enter. An agreement to renew a lease or relet the premises . . . cannot relieve the lessor of his duty to see that the premises are reasonably safe at that time.\u2019 [\u00b6] Where there is a duty to exercise reasonable care in the inspection of premises for dangerous conditions, the lack of awareness of the dangerous condition does not generally preclude liability. \u2018Although liability might easily be found where the landowner has actual knowledge of the dangerous condition \u201c[t]he landowner\u2019s lack of knowledge of the dangerous condition is not a defense. He has an affirmative duty to exercise ordinary care to keep the premises in a reasonably safe condition, and therefore must inspect them or take other proper means to ascertain their condition. And if, by the exercise of reasonable care, he would have discovered the dangerous condition, he is liable.\u201d \u2019 \u201d (Portillo v. Aiassa (1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 1128, 1134 [32 Cal.Rptr.2d 755], internal citations omitted.)</li><li>\u201cHistorically, the public policy of this state generally has precluded a landlord\u2019s liability for injuries to his tenant or his tenant\u2019s invitees from a dangerous condition on the premises which comes into existence after the tenant has taken possession. This is true even though by the exercise of reasonable diligence the landlord might have discovered the condition. [\u00b6] The rationale for this rule has been that property law regards a lease as equivalent to a sale of the land for the term of the lease. As stated by Prosser: \u2018In the absence of agreement to the contrary, the lessor surrenders both possession and control of the land to the lessee, retaining only a reversionary interest; and he has no right even to enter without the permission of the lessee. Consequently, it is the general rule that he is under no obligation to anyone to look after the premises or keep them in repair, and is not responsible, either to persons injured on the land or to those outside of it, for conditions which develop or are created by the tenant after possession has been transferred. Neither is he responsible, in general, for the activities which the tenant carries on upon the land after such transfer, even when they create a nuisance.\u2019 \u201d (Uccello v. Laudenslayer (1975) 44 Cal.App.3d 504, 510\u2013511 [118 Cal.Rptr. 741], internal citations omitted.)</li><li>\u201cTo this general rule of nonliability, the law has developed a number of exceptions, such as where the landlord covenants or volunteers to repair a defective condition on the premises, where the landlord has actual knowledge of defects which are unknown and not apparent to the tenant and he fails to disclose them to the tenant, where there is a nuisance existing on the property at the time the lease is made or renewed, when a safety law has been violated, or where the injury occurs on a part of the premises over which the landlord retains control, such as common hallways, stairs, elevators, or roof. [\u00b6] A common element in these exceptions is that either at or after the time possession is given to the tenant the landlord retains or acquires a recognizable degree of control over the dangerous condition with a concomitant right and power to obviate the condition and prevent the injury. In these situations, the law imposes on the landlord a duty to use ordinary care to eliminate the condition with resulting liability for injuries caused by his failure so to act.\u201d (Uccello, supra, 44 Cal.App.3d at p. 511, internal citations omitted.)</li><li>\u201c[W]here a landlord has relinquished control of property to a tenant, a \u2018bright line\u2019 rule has developed to moderate the landlord\u2019s duty of care owed to a third party injured on the property as compared with the tenant who enjoys possession and control. \u2018 \u201cBecause a landlord has relinquished possessory interest in the land, his or her duty of care to third parties injured on the land is attenuated as compared with the tenant who enjoys possession and control. Thus, before liability may be thrust on a landlord for a third party\u2019s injury due to a dangerous condition on the land, the plaintiff must show that the landlord had actual knowledge of the dangerous condition in question, plus the right and ability to cure the condition.\u201d [\u00b6] Limiting a landlord\u2019s obligations releases it from needing to engage in potentially intrusive oversight of the property, thus permitting the tenant to enjoy its tenancy unmolested.\u2019 \u201d (Salinas v. Martin (2008) 166 Cal.App.4th 404, 412 [82 Cal.Rptr.3d 735], internal citations omitted.)</li><li>\u201c[A] commercial landowner cannot totally abrogate its landowner responsibilities merely by signing a lease. As the owner of property, a lessor out of possession must exercise due care and must act reasonably toward the tenant as well as to unknown third persons. At the time the lease is executed and upon renewal a landlord has a right to reenter the property, has control of the property, and must inspect the premises to make the premises reasonably safe from dangerous conditions. Even if the commercial landlord executes a contract which requires the tenant to maintain the property in a certain condition, the landlord is obligated at the time the lease is executed to take reasonable precautions to avoid unnecessary danger.\u201d (Mora v. Baker Commodities, Inc. (1989) 210 Cal.App.3d 771, 781 [258 Cal.Rptr. 669], internal citations omitted.)</li><li>\u201c[T]he landlord\u2019s responsibility to inspect is limited. Like a residential landlord, the duty to inspect charges the lessor \u2018only with those matters which would have been disclosed by a reasonable inspection.\u2019 The burden of reducing or avoiding the risk and the likelihood of injury will affect the determination of what constitutes a reasonable inspection. The landlord\u2019s obligation is only to do what is reasonable under the circumstances. The landlord need not take extraordinary measures or make unreasonable expenditures of time and money in trying to discover hazards unless the circumstances so warrant. When there is a potential serious danger, which is foreseeable, a landlord should anticipate the danger and conduct a reasonable inspection before passing possession to the tenant. However, if no such inspection is warranted, the landlord has no such obligation.\u201d (Mora, supra, 210 Cal.App.3d at p. 782, internal citations and footnote omitted.)</li><li>\u201cIt is one thing for a landlord to leave a tenant alone who is complying with its lease. It is entirely different, however, for a landlord to ignore a defaulting tenant\u2019s possible neglect of property. Neglected property endangers the public, and a landlord\u2019s detachment frustrates the public policy of keeping property in good repair and safe. To strike the right balance between safety and disfavored self-help, we hold that [the landlord]\u2019s duty to inspect attached upon entry of the judgment of possession in the unlawful detainer action and included reasonable periodic inspections thereafter.\u201d (Stone v. Center Trust Retail Properties, Inc. (2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 608, 613 [77 Cal.Rptr.3d 556].)</li><li>\u201c[I]t is established that a landlord owes a duty of care to its tenants to take reasonable steps to secure the common areas under its control.\u201d (Ann M. v. Pacific Plaza Shopping Center (1993) 6 Cal.4th 666, 675 [25 Cal.Rptr.2d 137, 863 P.2d 207].)</li><li>\u201cThe reasonableness of a landlord\u2019s conduct under all the circumstances is for the jury. A triable issue of fact exists as to whether the defendants\u2019 maintenance of a low, open, unguarded window in a common hallway where they knew young children were likely to play constituted a breach of their duty to take reasonable precautions to prevent children falling out of the window.\u201d (Amos v. Alpha Prop. Mgmt. (1999) 73 Cal.App.4th 895, 904 [87 Cal.Rptr.2d 34], internal citation omitted.)</li><li>\u201cSimply stated, \u2018 \u201c[t]he duty which a possessor of land owes to others to put and maintain it in reasonably safe condition is nondelegable. If an independent contractor, no matter how carefully selected, is employed to perform it, the possessor is answerable for harm caused by the negligent failure of his contractor to put or maintain the buildings and structures in reasonably safe condition[.]\u201d \u2019 \u201d (Srithong, supra, 23 Cal.App.4th at p. 726.)</li></ul>",

        "sources_and_authority": "<ul><li>\u201cWe conclude that a hirer of an independent contractor is not liable to an employee of the contractor merely because the hirer retained control over safety conditions at a worksite, but that a hirer is liable to an employee of a contractor insofar as a hirer\u2019s exercise of retained control aff\u0131rmatively contributed to the employee\u2019s injuries.\u201d (Hooker, supra, 27 Cal.4th at p. 202, original italics.)</li><li>\u201cImposing tort liability on a hirer of an independent contractor when the hirer\u2019s conduct has affirmatively contributed to the injuries of the contractor\u2019s employee is consistent with the rationale of our decisions in Privette, Toland and Camargo because the liability of the hirer in such a case is not \u2018 \u201cin essence \u2018vicarious\u2019 or \u2018derivative\u2019 in the sense that it derives from the \u2018act or omission\u2019 of the hired contractor.\u201d \u2019 To the contrary, the liability of the hirer in such a case is direct in a much stronger sense of that term.\u201d (Hooker, supra, 27 Cal.4th at pp. 211\u2013212, original italics, internal citations and footnote omitted.)</li><li>\u201cSuch affirmative contribution need not always be in the form of actively directing a contractor or contractor\u2019s employee. There will be times when a hirer will be liable for its omissions. For example, if the hirer promises to undertake a particular safety measure, then the hirer\u2019s negligent failure to do so should result in liability if such negligence leads to an employee injury.\u201d (Hooker, supra, 27 Cal.4th at p. 212, fn. 3.)</li><li>\u201cIf a hirer entrusts work to an independent contractor, but retains control over safety conditions at a jobsite and then negligently exercises that control in a manner that affirmatively contributes to an employee\u2019s injuries, the hirer is liable for those injuries, based on its own negligent exercise of that retained control.\u201d (Tverberg v. Fillner Constr., Inc. (2012) 202 Cal.App.4th 1439, 1446 [136 Cal.Rptr.3d 521].)</li><li>\u201cWhen the employer directs that work be done by use of a particular mode or otherwise interferes with the means and methods of accomplishing the work, an affirmative contribution occurs. When the hirer does not fully delegate the task of providing a safe working environment but in some manner actively participates in how the job is done, the hirer may be held liable to the employee if its participation affirmatively contributed to the employee\u2019s injury. [\u00b6] By contrast, passively permitting an unsafe condition to occur rather than directing it to occur does not constitute affirmative contribution. The failure to institute specific safety measures is not actionable unless there is some evidence that the hirer or the contractor had agreed to implement these measures. Thus, the failure to exercise retained control does not constitute an affirmative contribution to an injury. Such affirmative contribution must be based on a negligent exercise of control. In order for a worker to recover on a retained control theory, the hirer must engage in some active participation.\u201d (Tverberg, supra, 202 Cal.App.4th at p. 1446, internal citations omitted.)</li><li>\u201c[U]nder Government Code section 815.4, a public entity can be held liable under the retained control doctrine, provided a private person would be liable under the same circumstances.

In other words, if the plaintiffs can show an inspection was not made within a particular period of time prior to an accident, they may raise an inference the condition did exist long enough for the owner to have discovered it. It remains a question of fact for the jury whether, under all the circumstances, the defective condition existed long enough so that it would have been discovered and remedied by an owner in the exercise of reasonable care.\u201d (Ortega, supra, at pp. 1212\u20131213, internal citations omitted.)</li><li>\u201cGenerally speaking, a property owner must have actual or constructive knowledge of a dangerous condition before liability will be imposed.

These statutes declare a general rule of immunity and then set out exceptions to that rule. Plaintiff invokes the exception for a dangerous condition of public property, as set out in Government Code section 835. As there laid out, the cause of action consists of the following elements: (1) a dangerous condition of public property; (2) a foreseeable risk, arising from the dangerous condition, of the kind of injury the plaintiff suffered; (3) actionable conduct in connection with the condition, i.e., either negligence on the part of a public employee in creating it, or failure by the entity to correct it after notice of its existence and dangerousness; (4) a causal relationship between the dangerous condition and the plaintiff\u2019s injuries; and (5) compensable damage sustained by the plaintiff.\u201d (Cole v.

Department of Transportation (2011) 201 Cal.App.4th 1475, 1481 [135 Cal.Rptr.3d 436].)</li><li>\u201cSubdivisions (a) and (b) of section 835 obviously address two different types of cases. However, what distinguishes the two types of cases is not simply whether the public entity has notice of the dangerous condition. Instead, what distinguishes the two cases in practice is who created the dangerous condition. Because an entity must act through its employees, virtually all suits brought on account of dangerous conditions created by the entity will be brought under subdivision (a). In contrast, subdivision (b) can also support suits based on dangerous conditions not created by the entity or its employees.\u201d (Brown, supra, 4 Cal.4th at p. 836.)</li><li>In section 835(a), \u201cthe term \u2018created\u2019 must be defined as the sort of involvement by an employee that would justify a presumption of notice on the entity\u2019s part.\u201d (Brown, supra, 4 Cal.4th at p. 836.) The res ipsa loquitur presumption does not satisfy section 835(a). (Ibid.)</li><li>\u201cFocusing on the language in Pritchard,  supra, 178 Cal.App.2d at page 256, stating that where the public entity \u2018has itself created the dangerous condition it is per se culpable,\u2019 plaintiff argues that the negligence that section 835, subdivision (a), refers to is not common law negligence, but something that exists whenever the public entity creates the dangerous condition of property. We disagree. If the Legislature had wanted to impose liability whenever a public entity created a dangerous condition, it would merely have required plaintiff to establish that an act or omission of an employee of the public entity within the scope of his employment created the dangerous condition. Instead, section 835, subdivision (a), requires the plaintiff to establish that a \u2018negligent or wrongful act or omission of an employee of the public entity within the scope of his employment created the dangerous condition.\u2019 (Italics added.) Plaintiff\u2019s interpretation would transform the highly meaningful words \u2018negligent or wrongful\u2019 into meaningless surplusage, contrary to the rule of statutory interpretation that courts should avoid a construction that makes any word surplusage.\u201d (Metcalf v. County of San Joaquin (2008) 42 Cal.4th 1121, 1135 [72 Cal.Rptr.3d 382, 176 P.3d 654], original italics, internal citation omitted.)</li><li>The plaintiff need not prove both that the public entity was negligent in creating the condition and that it had notice of the condition; either negligence or notice is sufficient.

Therefore, the crucial element is not ownership, but rather control.\u201d (Mamola v. State of California ex rel.

As it noted, normally \u2018negligence is the absence of reasonableness.\u2019 That being the case, the court reasoned, one cannot reasonably act negligently. Because of this conundrum, the Court of Appeal found that section 835.4 does not provide an affirmative defense. (\u00b6) We disagree. Section 835.4 clearly creates an affirmative defense that the public entity must establish. Moreover, the Legislature created this defense specifically for public entities. The California Law Revision Commission explained, \u2018Under this section, a public entity may absolve itself from liability for creating or failing to remedy a dangerous condition by showing that it would have been too costly and impractical for the public entity to have done anything else. . . . This defense has been provided public entities in recognition that, despite limited manpower and budgets, there is much that they are required to do. Unlike private enterprise, a public entity often cannot weigh the advantage of engaging in an activity against the cost and decide not to engage in it. Government cannot \u2018go out of the business\u2019 of governing. Therefore, a public entity should not be liable for injuries caused by a dangerous condition if it is able to show that under all the circumstances, including the alternative courses of action available to it and the practicability and cost of pursuing such alternatives, its action in creating or failing to remedy the condition was not unreasonable.\u2019 \u201d (Metcalf v. County of San Joaquin (2008) 42 Cal.4th 1121, 1137\u20131138 [72 Cal.Rptr.3d 382, 176 P.3d 654], footnote and internal citation omitted.)</li><li>\u201cThe reasonableness standard referred to in section 835.4 differs from the reasonableness standard that applies under sections 830 and 835 and ordinary tort principles.

If, on the other hand, the government installs traffic signals and invites the public to justifiably rely on them, liability will attach if the signals malfunction, confusing or misleading motorists, and causing an accident to occur.

        "directions_for_use": "<p>With regard to element 2, it has been often stated in the case law that a manufacturer is liable for failure to warn of a risk that is \u201cknowable in light of generally recognized and prevailing best scientific and medical knowledge available.\u201d (See, e.g., <i>Anderson v. Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp.</i> (1991) 53 Cal.3d 987, 1002 [281 Cal.Rptr. 528, 810 P.2d 549]; <i>Carlin v. Superior Court</i> (1996) 13 Cal.4th 1104, 1112 [56 Cal.Rptr.2d 162, 920 P.2d 1347]; <i>Saller v. Crown Cork &amp; Seal Company</i> (2010) 187 Cal.App.4th 1220, 1239 [115 Cal.Rptr.3d 151]; <i>Rosa v. City of Seaside</i> (N.D. Cal. 2009) 675 F.Supp. 2d 1006, 1012.) The advisory committee believes that this standard is captured by the phrase \u201cgenerally accepted in the scientific community.\u201d A risk may be \u201cgenerally recognized\u201d as a view (knowledge) advanced by one body of scientific thought and experiment, but it may not be the \u201cprevailing\u201d or \u201cbest\u201d scientific view; that is, it may be a minority view. The committee believes that when a risk is (1) generally recognized (2) as prevailing in the relevant scientific community, and (3) represents the best scholarship available, it is sufficient to say that the risk is knowable in light of \u201cthe generally accepted\u201d scientific knowledge.</p><p>The last bracketed paragraph should be read only in prescription product cases: \u201cIn the case of prescription drugs and implants, the physician stands in the shoes of the \u2018ordinary user\u2019 because it is through the physician that a patient learns of the properties and proper use of the drug or implant. Thus, the duty to warn in these cases runs to the physician, not the patient.\u201d (<i>Valentine v. Baxter Healthcare Corp.</i> (1999) 68 Cal.App.4th 1467, 1483 [81 Cal.Rptr.2d 252].)</p><p>To make a prima facie case, the plaintiff has the initial burden of producing evidence that he or she was injured while the product was being used in an intended or reasonably foreseeable manner. If this prima facie burden is met, the burden of proof shifts to the defendant to prove that the plaintiff\u2019s injury resulted from a misuse of the product. (See <i>Perez v. VAS S.p.A.</i> (2010) 188 Cal.App.4th 658, 678 [115 Cal.Rptr.3d 590] [risk-benefit design defect case].) See also CACI No. 1245, <i>Aff\u0131rmative Defense\u2014Product Misuse or Modification</i>. Product misuse is a complete defense to strict products liability if the defendant proves that an unforeseeable abuse or alteration of the product after it left the manufacturer\u2019s hands was the sole cause of the plaintiff\u2019s injury. (<i>Campbell v. Southern Pacific Co.</i> (1978) 22 Cal.3d 51, 56 [148 Cal.Rptr. 596, 583 P.2d 121]; see CACI No. 1245.) Misuse or modification that was a substantial factor in, but not the sole cause of, plaintiff\u2019s harm may also be considered in determining the comparative fault of the plaintiff or of third persons. See CACI No. 1207A, <i>Strict Liability\u2014Comparative Fault of Plaintiff</i>, and CACI No. 1207B, <i>Strict Liability\u2014Comparative Fault of Third Person</i>.</p>", 
        "sources_and_authority": "<ul><li>\u201cOur law recognizes that even \u2018 \u201ca product flawlessly designed and produced may nevertheless possess such risks to the user without a suitable warning that it becomes \u2018defective\u2019 simply by the absence of a warning.\u201d . . .\u2019 Thus, manufacturers have a duty to warn consumers about the hazards inherent in their products. The purpose of requiring adequate warnings is to inform consumers about a product\u2019s hazards and faults of which they are unaware, so that the consumer may then either refrain from using the product altogether or avoid the danger by careful use.\u201d (<i>Taylor v. Elliott Turbomachinery Co.</i>, Inc. (2009) 171 Cal.App.4th 564, 577 [90 Cal.Rptr.3d 414], internal citations and footnote omitted.)</li><li>\u201cNegligence and strict products liability are separate and distinct bases for liability that do not automatically collapse into each other because the plaintiff might allege both when a product warning contributes to her injury.\u201d (<i>Conte v. Wyeth, Inc.</i> (2008) 168 Cal.App.4th 89, 101 [85 Cal.Rptr.3d 299].)</li><li>\u201c[F]ailure to warn in strict liability differs markedly from failure to warn in the negligence context. Negligence law in a failure-to-warn case requires a plaintiff to prove that a manufacturer or distributor did not warn of a particular risk for reasons which fell below the acceptable standard of care, i.e., what a reasonably prudent manufacturer would have known and warned about. Strict liability is not concerned with the standard of due care or the reasonableness of a manufacturer\u2019s conduct. The rules of strict liability require a plaintiff to prove only that the defendant did not adequately warn of a particular risk that was known or knowable in light of the generally recognized and prevailing best scientific and medical knowledge available at the time of manufacture and distribution\u2026 [\u00b6] [T]he manufacturer is liable if it failed to give warning of dangers that were known to the scientific community at the time it manufactured or distributed the product. Thus, in strict liability, as opposed to negligence, the reasonableness of the defendant\u2019s failure to warn is immaterial.\u201d (<i>Anderson, supra</i>, 53 Cal.3d at pp.1002\u20141003.)</li><li>\u201cIt is true that the two types of failure to warn claims are not necessarily exclusive: \u2018No valid reason appears to require a plaintiff to elect whether to proceed on the theory of strict liability in tort or on the theory of negligence\u2026 [\u00b6] Nor does it appear that instructions on the two theories will be confusing to the jury. There is nothing inconsistent in instructions on the two theories and to a large extent the two theories parallel and supplement each other.\u2019 Despite the often significant overlap between the theories of negligence and strict liability based on a product defect, a plaintiff is entitled to instructions on both theories if both are supported by the evidence.\u201d (<i>Oxford v. Foster Wheeler LLC</i> (2009) 177 Cal.App.4th 700, 717 [99 Cal.Rptr.3d 418].)</li><li>\u201cThe actual knowledge of the individual manufacturer, even if reasonably prudent, is not the issue. We view the standard to require that the manufacturer is held to the knowledge and skill of an expert in the field; it is obliged to keep abreast of any scientific discoveries and is presumed to know the results of all such advances.\u201d (<i>Carlin, supra,</i> 13 Cal.4th at p. 1113, fn. 3.)</li><li>\u201c[A] defendant in a strict products liability action based upon an alleged failure to warn of a risk of harm may present evidence of the state of the art, i.e., evidence that the particular risk was neither known nor knowable by the application of scientific knowledge available at the time of manufacture and/or distribution.\u201d (<i>Anderson, supra,</i> 53 Cal.3d at p. 1004.)</li><li>\u201c[T]here can be no liability for failure to warn where the instructions or warnings sufficiently alert the user to the possibility of danger.\u201d (<i>Aguayo v. Crompton &amp; Knowles Corp.</i> (1986) 183 Cal.App.3d 1032, 1042 [228 Cal.Rptr. 768], internal citation omitted.)</li><li>\u201cA duty to warn or disclose danger arises when an article is or should be known to be dangerous for its intended use, either inherently or because of defects.\u201d (<i>DeLeon v. Commercial Manufacturing and Supply Co.</i> (1983) 148 Cal.App.3d 336, 343 [195 Cal.Rptr. 867], internal citation omitted.)</li><li>\u201cCalifornia is well settled into the majority view that knowledge, actual or constructive, is a requisite for strict liability for failure to warn  \u2026\u201d (<i>Anderson, supra,</i> 53 Cal.3d at p. 1000.)</li><li>\u201c[T]he duty to warn is not conditioned upon [actual or constructive] knowledge [of a danger] where the defectiveness of a product depends on the adequacy of instructions furnished by the supplier which are essential to the assembly and use of its product.\u201d (<i>Midgley v. S. S. Kresge Co.</i> (1976) 55 Cal.App.3d 67, 74 [127 Cal.Rptr. 217].)</li><li>Under <i>Cronin</i>, plaintiffs in cases involving manufacturing and design defects do not have to prove that a defect made a product unreasonably dangerous; however, that case \u201cdid not preclude weighing the degree of dangerousness in the failure to warn cases.\u201d (<i>Cavers v. Cushman Motor Sales, Inc.</i> (1979) 95 Cal.App.3d 338, 343 [157 Cal.Rptr. 142].)</li><li>\u201c[T]he warning requirement is not limited to unreasonably or unavoidably dangerous products. Rather, directions or warnings are in order where reasonably required <i>to prevent the use of a product from becoming unreasonably dangerous</i>. It is the lack of such a warning which renders a product unreasonably dangerous and therefore defective.\u201d (<i>Gonzales v. Carmenita Ford Truck Sales, Inc.</i> (1987) 192 Cal.App.3d 1143, 1151 [238 Cal.Rptr. 18], original italics.)</li><li>\u201cIn most cases, . . . the adequacy of a warning is a question of fact for the jury.\u201d (<i>Jackson v. Deft, Inc.</i> (1990) 223 Cal.App.3d 1305, 1320 [273 Cal.Rptr. 214].)</li><li>\u201c[A] pharmaceutical manufacturer may not be required to provide warning of a risk known to the medical community.\u201d (<i>Carlin, supra,</i> 13 Cal.4th at p. 1116.)</li><li>\u201cTo be liable in California, even under a strict liability theory, the plaintiff must prove that the defendant\u2019s failure to warn was a substantial factor in causing his or her injury. (CACI No. 1205.) The natural corollary to this requirement is that a defendant is not liable to a plaintiff if the injury would have occurred even if the defendant had issued adequate warnings.\u201d (<i>Huitt v. Southern California Gas Co.</i> (2010) 188 Cal.App.4th 1586, 1604 [116 Cal.Rptr.3d 453].)</li><li>\u201c[A] manufacturer\u2019s liability to the ultimate consumer may be extinguished by \u2018intervening cause\u2019 where the manufacturer either provides adequate warnings to a middleman or the middleman alters the product before passing it to the final consumer.\u201d (<i>Garza v. Asbestos Corp., Ltd.</i> (2008) 161 Cal.App.4th 651, 661 [74 Cal.Rptr.3d 359].)</li><li>\u201c \u2018A manufacturer\u2019s duty to warn is a continuous duty which lasts as long as the product is in use.\u2019 . . . [T]he manufacturer must continue to provide physicians with warnings, at least so long as it is manufacturing and distributing the product.\u201d (<i>Valentine, supra,</i> 68 Cal.App.4th at p. 1482.)</li><li>\u201c \u2018[T]he law now requires a manufacturer to foresee some degree of misuse and abuse of his product, either by the user or by third parties, and to take reasonable precautions to minimize the harm that may result from misuse and abuse\u2026 [T]he extent to which designers and manufacturers of dangerous machinery are required to anticipate safety neglect presents an issue of fact\u2026 [A] manufacturer owes a foreseeable user of its product a duty to warn of risks of using the product.\u2019 \u201d (Wright v. Stang Manufacturing Co. (1997) 54 Cal.App.4th 1218, 1235 [63 Cal.Rptr.2d 422].)</li><li>\u201cCalifornia case law has not imposed on manufacturers a duty to warn about the dangerous propensities of other manufacturers\u2019 products. California courts will not impose a duty to warn on a manufacturer where the manufacturer\u2019s product \u2018did not cause or create the risk of harm.\u2019 As one commentary explains, \u2018[t]he product must, in some sense of the word, \u201ccreate\u201d the risk. If it does not, then the manufacturer should not be required to supply warnings, even if the risks are not obvious to users and consumers.\u2019 As California law now stands, unless the manufacturer\u2019s product in some way causes or creates the risk of harm, \u2018the risks of the manufacturer\u2019s own product . . . are the only risks [the manufacturer] is required to know.\u2019 \u201d (<i>Taylor, supra</i>, 171 Cal.App.4th at p. 583, internal citations omitted; cf. <i>O\u2019Neil v.

Whereas plaintiffs in the past have had to prove their reliance upon specific promises made by the seller, the Uniform Commercial Code requires no such proof. According to official comment 3 to the Uniform Commercial Code following section 2313, \u2018no particular reliance . . . need be shown in order to weave [the seller\u2019s affirmations of fact] into the fabric of the agreement. Rather, any fact which is to take such affirmations, once made, out of the agreement requires clear affirmative proof.\u2019 \u201d (<i>Hauter v. Zogarts</i> (1975) 14 Cal.3d 104, 115 [120 Cal.Rptr. 681, 534 P.2d 377, internal citations and footnote omitted.)</li><li>\u201cThe California Supreme Court, in discussing the continued viability of the reliance factor, noted that commentators have disagreed in regard to the impact of this development. Some have indicated that it shifts the burden of proving nonreliance to the seller, and others have indicated that the code eliminates the concept of reliance altogether.\u201d (<i>Keith v. Buchanan</i> (1985) 173 Cal.App.3d 13, 22 [220 Cal.Rptr. 392], citing <i>Hauter</i>, <i>supra</i>, 14 Cal.3d at pp. 115\u2014116.)</li><li>\u201cThe official Uniform Commercial Code comment in regard to section 2-313 \u2018indicates that in actual practice affirmations of fact made by the seller about the goods during a bargain are regarded as part of the description of those goods; hence no particular reliance on such statements need be shown in order to weave them into the fabric of the agreement.\u2019 It is clear from the new language of this code section that the concept of reliance has been purposefully abandoned.\u201d (<i>Keith</i>, <i>supra</i>, 173 Cal.App.3d at p. 23, internal citations omitted.)</li><li>\u201cThe change of the language in section 2313 of the California Uniform Commercial Code modifies both the degree of reliance and the burden of proof in express warranties under the code. A warranty statement made by a seller is presumptively part of the basis of the bargain, and the burden is on the seller to prove that the resulting bargain does not rest at all on the representation.\u201d (<i>Keith</i>, <i>supra</i>, 173 Cal.App.3d at p. 23.)</li><li>\u201c[O]nce affirmations have been made, they are woven into the fabric of the agreement and the seller must present \u2018clear affirmative proof\u2019 to remove them from the agreement.\u201d (<i>Weinstat v. Dentsply International, Inc.</i> (2010) 180 Cal.App.4th 1213, 1234 [103 Cal.Rptr.3d 614.)</li><li>\u201c[W]hile the basis of the bargain of course includes dickered terms to which the buyer specifically assents, section 2313 itself does not suggest that express warranty protection is confined to them such that affirmations by the seller that are not dickered are excluded. Any affirmation, once made, is part of the agreement unless there is \u2018clear affirmative proof\u2019 that the affirmation has been taken out of the agreement.\u201d (<i>Weinstat</i>, supra, 180 Cal.App.4th at p. 1229.)</li><li>\u201cThe official comment to section 2313 is also instructive on this point, providing: \u2018The precise time when words of description or affirmation are made . . . is not material. The sole question is whether the language . . . [is] fairly to be regarded as part of the contract.\u2019 Thus, the California Uniform Commercial Code contemplates that affirmations, promises and descriptions about the goods contained in product manuals and other materials that are given to the buyer at the time of delivery can become part of the basis of the bargain, and can be \u2018fairly . . . regarded as part of the contract,\u2019 notwithstanding that delivery occurs after the purchase price has been paid.\u201d (<i>Weinstat</i>, <i>supra</i>, 180 Cal.App.4th at p. 1230.)</li><li>\u201cThe buyer\u2019s actual knowledge of the true condition of the goods prior to the making of the contract may make it plain that the seller\u2019s statement was not relied upon as one of the inducements for the purchase, but the burden is on the seller to demonstrate such knowledge on the part of the buyer. Where the buyer inspects the goods before purchase, he may be deemed to have waived the seller\u2019s express warranties. But, an examination or inspection by the buyer of the goods does not necessarily discharge the seller from an express warranty if the defect was not actually discovered and waived.\u201d (<i>Keith</i>, <i>supra</i>, 173 Cal.App.3d at pp. 23\u201424.)</li><li>\u201cFirst, . . . affirmations and descriptions in product literature received at the time of delivery but after payment of the purchase price are, without more, part of the basis of the bargain, period. Second, the seller\u2019s right to rebut goes to proof that extracts the affirmations from the \u2018agreement\u2019 or \u2018bargain of the parties in fact,\u2019 not, as <i>Keith</i> would suggest, to proof that they were not an inducement for the purchase. Relying on <i>Keith</i>, the court in effect equated the concept of the \u2018bargain in fact of the parties\u2019 with the concept of reliance, but . . . the two are not synonymous. Moreover, the opinion in <i>Keith</i> contradicts itself on this matter. On the one hand the opinion states unequivocally that \u2018[i]t is clear\u2019 section 2313 \u2018purposefully abandoned\u2019 the concept of reliance. On the other hand, we must ask if section 2313 has eliminated the concept of reliance from express warranty law all together, by what logic can reliance reappear, by its absence, as an affirmative defense?\u201d (<i>Weinstat</i>, <i>supra</i>, 180 Cal.App.4th at p. 1234, internal citation omitted.)</li></ul>",

The court concluded that \u2018state law which holds Government contractors liable for design defects in military equipment does in some circumstances present a \u201csignificant conflict\u201d with federal policy and must be displaced.\u2019 \u201d (<i>Oxford, supra</i>, 177 Cal.App.4th at p. 708, quoting <i>Boyle, supra</i>, 487 U.S. at pp. 500, 504, 507, 512.)</li><li>\u201cLiability for design defects in military equipment cannot be imposed, pursuant to state law, when (1) the United States approved reasonably precise specifications; (2) the equipment conformed to those specifications; and (3) the supplier warned the United States about the dangers in the use of the equipment that were known to the supplier but not to the United States. The first two of these conditions assure that the suit is within the area where the policy of the \u2018discretionary function\u2019 would be frustrated\u2014i.e., they assure that the design feature in question was considered by a Government officer, and not merely by the contractor itself. The third condition is necessary because, in its absence, the displacement of state tort law would create some incentive for the manufacturer to withhold knowledge of risks, since conveying that knowledge might disrupt the contract but withholding it would produce no liability. We adopt this provision lest our effort to protect discretionary functions perversely impede them by cutting off information highly relevant to the discretionary decision.\u201d (<i>Boyle, supra</i>, 487 U.S. at pp. 512\u2014513.)</li><li>\u201c[T]he fact that a company supplies goods to the military does not, in and of itself, immunize it from liability for the injuries caused by those goods.

Though the court in <i>Boyle</i> discussed the parameters of the contractor defense in terms of \u2018military equipment,\u2019 use of that term appears to have followed from the facts of that case. Other courts considering this issue have concluded the defense is not limited to military contracts\u2026 [<i>Boyle\u2019s</i>] application focuses instead on whether the issue or area is one involving \u2018uniquely federal interests\u2019 and, if so, whether the application of state law presents a \u2018significant conflict\u2019 with federal policy.\u201d (<i>Oxford, supra</i>, 177 Cal.App.4th at p. 710; the split on this issue in the federal and other state courts is noted in <i>Carley v.

Boeing Helicopters</i> (6th Cir. 1995) 55 F.3d 1150, 1157] offered an alternative test for applying the government contractor defense in the context of failure to warn claims: \u2018When state law would otherwise impose liability for a failure to warn of dangers in using military equipment, that law is displaced if the contractor can show: (1) the United States exercised its discretion and approved the warnings, if any; (2) the contractor provided warnings that conformed to the approved warnings; and (3) the contractor warned the United States of the dangers in the equipment\u2019s use about which the contractor knew, but the United States did not.\u2019 \u201d (<i>Oxford</i>, <i>supra</i>, 177 Cal.App.4th at p. 712.)</li><li>\u201cAs in design defect cases, in order to satisfy the first condition\u2014government \u2018approval\u2019\u2014in failure to warn cases, the government\u2019s involvement must transcend rubber stamping. And where the government goes beyond approval and actually determines for itself the warnings to be provided, the contractor has surely satisfied the first condition because the government exercised its discretion. The second condition in failure to warn cases, as in design defect cases, assures that the defense protects the government\u2019s, not the contractor\u2019s, exercise of discretion. Finally, the third condition encourages frank communication to the government of the equipment\u2019s dangers and increases the likelihood that the government will make a well-informed judgment.\u201d (<i>Oxford</i>, supra, 177 Cal.App.4th at p. 712, quoting Tate, supra, 55 F.3d at p. 1157.)</li><li>\u201cUnder California law, a manufacturer has a duty to warn of a danger when the manufacturer has knowledge of the danger or has reason to know of it and has no reason to know that those who use the product will realize its dangerous condition. Whereas the government contractor\u2019s defense may be used to trump a design defect claim by proving that the government, not the contractor, is responsible for the defective design, that defense is inapplicable to a failure to warn claim in the absence of evidence that in making its decision whether to provide a warning . . . , [defendant] was \u2018acting in compliance with \u201creasonably precise specifications\u201d imposed on [it] by the United States.\u2019 \u201d (<i>Butler v.

Although defendants\u2019 evidence did show that certain warnings were required by the military specifications, that evidence did not establish that the specifications placed any limitation on additional information from the manufacturers to users of their products. Instead, the evidence suggested no such limitation existed.\u201d (<i>Jackson v.

The existence of justification is a matter which ordinarily lies peculiarly within the knowledge of the defendant. The plaintiff would encounter almost insurmountable practical problems in attempting to prove the negative proposition of the nonexistence of any justification. This rule also serves to assure that official intermeddling is justified, for it is a serious matter to accuse someone of committing a crime and to arrest him without the protection of the warrant process.\u201d (<i>Cervantez v.

Regalia</i> (2009) 172 Cal.App.4th 361, 367 [90 Cal.Rptr.3d 882], internal citations omitted.)</li><li>\u201cWith respect to slander per se, the trial court decides if the alleged statement falls within Civil Code section 46, subdivisions 1 through 4. It is then for the trier of fact to determine if the statement is defamatory. This allocation of responsibility may appear, at first glance, to result in an overlap of responsibilities because a trial court determination that the statement falls within those categories would seemingly suggest that the statement, if false, is necessarily defamatory. But a finder of fact might rely upon extraneous evidence to conclude that, under the circumstances, the statement was not defamatory.\u201d (<i>The Nethercutt Collection, supra</i>, 172 Cal.App.4th at pp. 368-369.)</li><li>\u201c \u2018 \u201cThe sine qua non of recovery for defamation . . . is the existence of falsehood.\u201d . . . Because the statement must contain a provable falsehood, courts distinguish between statements of fact and statements of opinion for purposes of defamation liability. Although statements of fact may be actionable as libel, statements of opinion are constitutionally protected\u2026\u2019 That does not mean that statements of opinion enjoy blanket protection. On the contrary, where an expression of opinion implies a false assertion of fact, the opinion can constitute actionable defamation. The critical question is not whether a statement is fact or opinion, but \u2018 \u201cwhether a reasonable fact finder could conclude the published statement declares or implies a provably false assertion of fact.\u201d \u2019 \u201d (<i>Wong, supra</i>, 189 Cal.App.4th at p. 1370, internal citations omitted.)</li><li>\u201c \u2018To determine whether a statement is actionable fact or nonactionable opinion, courts use a totality of the circumstances test of whether the statement in question communicates or implies a provably false statement of fact\u2026 Under the totality of the circumstances test, \u201c[f]irst, the language of the statement is examined.

Lopez</i> (2010) 190 Cal.App.4th 1248, 1261 [119 Cal.Rptr.3d 127].)</li><li>\u201c[T]he jury was instructed that if it found that defendant published matter that was defamatory on its face and it found by clear and convincing evidence that defendant knew the statement was false or published it in reckless disregard of whether it was false, then the jury \u2018also may award plaintiff presumed general damages.\u2019 Presumed damages \u2018are those damages that necessarily result from the publication of defamatory matter and are presumed to exist. They include reasonable compensation for loss of reputation, shame, mortification, and hurt feeling. No definite standard or method of calculation is prescribed by law by which to fix reasonable compensation for presumed damages, and no evidence of actual harm is required. Nor is the opinion of any witness required as to the amount of such reasonable compensation. In making an award for presumed damages, you shall exercise your authority with calm and reasonable judgment and the damages you fix shall be just and reasonable in the light of the evidence. You may in the exercise of your discretion award nominal damages only, namely an insignificant sum such as one dollar.\u2019 [\u00b6] . . . [\u00b6] . . . [T]he instant instruction, which limits damages to \u2018those damages that necessarily result from the publication of defamatory matter,\u2019 constitutes substantial compliance with [Civil Code] section 3283. Thus, the instant instructions, \u2018if obeyed, did not allow the jurors to \u201center the realm of speculation\u201d regarding future suffering.\u2019 \u201d (<i>Sommer v. Gabor</i> (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 1455, 1472\u20141473 [48 Cal.Rptr.2d 235], internal citations omitted.)</li><li>\u201cIn defamation actions generally, factual truth is a defense which it is the defendant\u2019s burden to prove. In a defamation action against a newspaper by a private person suing over statements of public concern, however, the First Amendment places the burden of proving falsity on the plaintiff. As a matter of constitutional law, therefore, media statements on matters of public interest, including statements of opinion which reasonably imply a knowledge of facts, \u2018must be provable as false before there can be liability under state defamation law.\u2019 \u201d (<i>Eisenberg v. Alameda Newspapers</i> (1999) 74 Cal.App.4th 1359, 1382 [88 Cal.Rptr.2d 802], internal citations omitted.)</li><li>In matters involving public concern, the First Amendment protection applies to nonmedia defendants, putting the burden of proving falsity of the statement on the plaintiff. (<i>Nizam-Aldine v. City of Oakland</i> (1996) 47 Cal.App.4th 364, 375 [54 Cal.Rptr.2d 781].)</li><li>\u201cPublication means communication to some third person who understands the defamatory meaning of the statement and its application to the person to whom reference is made. Publication need not be to the \u2018public\u2019 at large; communication to a single individual is sufficient.\u201d (<i>Smith, supra,</i> 72 Cal.App.4th at p. 645, internal citations omitted.)</li><li>\u201c[W]hen a party repeats a slanderous charge, he is equally guilty of defamation, even though he states the source of the charge and indicates that he is merely repeating a rumor.\u201d (<i>Jackson v. Paramount Pictures Corp.</i> (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 10, 26 [80 Cal.Rptr.2d 1], internal citation omitted.)</li><li>\u201cAt common law, one who republishes a defamatory statement is deemed thereby to have adopted it and so may be held liable, together with the person who originated the statement, for resulting injury to the reputation of the defamation victim. California has adopted the common law in this regard, although by statute the republication of defamatory statements is privileged in certain defined situations.\u201d (<i>Khawar v. Globe Internat.</i> (1998) 19 Cal.4th 254, 268 [79 Cal.Rptr.2d 178, 965 P.2d 696], internal citations omitted.)</li><li>The general rule is that \u201ca plaintiff cannot manufacture a defamation cause of action by publishing the statements to third persons; the publication must be done by the defendant.\u201d There is an exception to this rule. [When it is foreseeable that the plaintiff] \u201c \u2018will be under a strong compulsion to disclose the contents of the defamatory statement to a third person after he has read it or been informed of its contents.\u2019 \u201d (<i>Live Oak Publishing Co. v. Cohagan</i> (1991) 234 Cal.App.3d 1277, 1284 [286 Cal.Rptr. 198], internal citations omitted.)</li><li>Whether a plaintiff in a defamation action is a public figure is a question of law for the trial court.

Superior Court</i> (1984) 37 Cal.3d 244, 252 [208 Cal.Rptr. 137, 690 P.2d 610].) \u201cThe question whether a plaintiff is a public figure is to be determined by the court, not the jury.\u201d (<i>Stolz v. KSFM 102 FM</i> (1994) 30 Cal.App.4th 195, 203 [35 Cal.Rptr.2d 740], internal citation omitted.)</li><li>\u201cTo qualify as a limited purpose public figure, a plaintiff \u2018must have undertaken some voluntary [affirmative] act[ion] through which he seeks to influence the resolution of the public issues involved.\u2019 \u201d (<i>Rudnick v. McMillan</i> (1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 1183, 1190 [31 Cal.Rptr.2d 193]; see also <i>Mosesian v. McClatchy Newspapers</i> (1991) 233 Cal.App.3d 1685, 1689 [285 Cal.Rptr. 430].)</li><li>\u201cThe First Amendment limits California\u2019s libel law in various respects. When, as here, the plaintiff is a public figure, he cannot recover unless he proves by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant published the defamatory statement with actual malice, i.e., with \u2018knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.\u2019 Mere negligence does not suffice. Rather, the plaintiff must demonstrate that the author \u2018in fact entertained serious doubts as to the truth of his publication,\u2019 or acted with a \u2018high degree of awareness of . . . probable falsity.\u2019 \u201d (<i>Masson v.

They include reasonable compensation for loss of reputation, shame, mortification, and hurt feeling. No definite standard or method of calculation is prescribed by law by which to fix reasonable compensation for presumed damages, and no evidence of actual harm is required. Nor is the opinion of any witness required as to the amount of such reasonable compensation. In making an award for presumed damages, you shall exercise your authority with calm and reasonable judgment and the damages you fix shall be just and reasonable in the light of the evidence.

Santa Cruz Women Against Rape</i> (1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 1009, 1016 [271 Cal.Rptr. 30].)</li><li>\u201cA private-figure plaintiff must prove at least negligence to recover any damages and, when the speech involves a matter of public concern, he must also prove <i>New York Times</i> malice . . . to recover presumed or punitive damages.\u201d (<i>Brown v. Kelly Broadcasting Co.</i> (1989) 48 Cal.3d 711, 747 [257 Cal.Rptr. 708, 771 P.2d 406].)</li><li>\u201cThe First Amendment trumps the common law presumption of falsity in defamation cases involving private-figure plaintiffs when the allegedly defamatory statements pertain to a matter of public interest.\u201d (<i>Nizam- Aldine v.

However, in accommodation of First Amendment considerations (which are implicated by state defamation laws), where the plaintiff is a public figure, the \u2018public-figure plaintiff must show the falsity of the statements at issue in order to prevail in a suit for defamation.\u2019 \u201d (<i>Stolz, supra,</i> 30 Cal.App.4th at p. 202, internal citations omitted.)</li><li>\u201cSince the statements at issue here involved a matter of purely private concern communicated between private individuals, we do not regard them as raising a First Amendment issue. \u2018While such speech is not totally unprotected by the First Amendment, its protections are less stringent\u2019 [than that applying to speech on matters of public concern].\u201d (<i>Savage v.

They include reasonable compensation for loss of reputation, shame, mortification, and hurt feeling. No definite standard or method of calculation is prescribed by law by which to fix reasonable compensation for presumed damages, and no evidence of actual harm is required. Nor is the opinion of any witness required as to the amount of such reasonable compensation. In making an award for presumed damages, you shall exercise your authority with calm and reasonable judgment and the damages you fix shall be just and reasonable in the light of the evidence. You may in the exercise of your discretion award nominal damages only, namely an insignificant sum such as one dollar.\u2019 [\u00b6\u00b6] . . . [T]he instant instruction, which limits damages to \u2018those damages that necessarily result from the publication of defamatory matter,\u2019 constitutes substantial compliance with [Civil Code] section 3283.

[\u00b6] [I]n defamation actions the general rule is that publication occurs when the defendant communicates the defamatory statement to a person other than the person being defamed.

If we were to recognize delayed accrual of a cause of action based upon the allegedly defamatory statement contained in the book . . . on the basis that plaintiff did not happen to come across the statement until some time after the book was first generally distributed to the public, we would be adopting a rule subjecting publishers and authors to potential liability during the entire period in which a single copy of the book or newspaper might exist and fall into the hands of the subject of a defamatory remark. Inquiry into whether delay in discovering the publication was reasonable has not been permitted for publications governed by the single-publication rule. Nor is adoption of the rule proposed by plaintiff appropriate simply because the originator of a privately communicated defamatory statement may, together with the author and the publisher of a book, be liable for the defamation contained in the book. Under the rationale for the single- publication rule, the originator, who is jointly responsible along with the author and the publisher, should not be liable for millions of causes of action for a single edition of the book.

National Collegiate Athletic Assn.</i> (1994) 7 Cal.4th 1, 24 [26 Cal.Rptr.2d 834, 865 P.2d 633].)</li><li>The tort of intrusion \u201cencompasses unconsented-to physical intrusion into the home, hospital room or other place the privacy of which is legally recognized, as well as unwarranted sensory intrusions such as eavesdropping, wiretapping, and visual or photographic spying.\u201d (<i>Shulman v. Group W Productions, Inc.</i> (1998) 18 Cal.4th 200, 230 [74 Cal.Rptr.2d 843, 955 P.2d 469], internal citation omitted.)</li><li>The right of privacy was first recognized in California in the case of <i>Melvin v. Reid</i> (1931) 112 Cal.App. 285, 291 [297 P. 91]. The court found a legal foundation for the tort in the right to pursue and obtain happiness found in article I, section 1 of the California Constitution.</li><li>\u201cThe foregoing arguments have been framed throughout this action in terms of both the common law and the state Constitution. These two sources of privacy protection \u2018are not unrelated\u2019 under California law. (<i>Shulman, supra</i>, 18 Cal.4th 200, 227; accord, <i>Hill, supra</i>, 7 Cal.4th 1, 27; but see <i>Katzberg v. Regents of University of California</i> (2002) 29 Cal.4th 300, 313, fn. 13 [127 Cal.Rptr.2d 482, 58 P.3d 339] [suggesting it is an open question whether the state constitutional privacy provision, which is otherwise self-executing and serves as the basis for injunctive relief, can also provide direct and sole support for a damages claim].)\u201d (<i>Hernandez v. Hillsides, Inc.</i> (2009) 47 Cal.4th 272, 286 [97 Cal.Rptr.3d 274, 211 P.3d 1063].)</li><li>\u201c[W]e will assess the parties\u2019 claims and the undisputed evidence under the rubric of both the common law and constitutional tests for establishing a privacy violation. Borrowing certain shorthand language from <i>Hill, supra</i>, 7 Cal.4th 1, which distilled the largely parallel elements of these two causes of action, we consider (1) the nature of any intrusion upon reasonable expectations of privacy, and (2) the offensiveness or seriousness of the intrusion, including any justification and other relevant interests.\u201d (<i>Hernandez, supra</i>, 47 Cal.4th at p. 288.)</li><li>The element of intrusion \u201cis not met when the plaintiff has merely been observed, or even photographed or recorded, in a public place. Rather, \u2018the plaintiff must show the defendant penetrated some zone of physical or sensory privacy surrounding, or obtained unwanted access to data about, the plaintiff.\u2019 \u201d (<i>Sanders v. American Broadcasting Co.</i> (1999) 20 Cal.4th 907, 914\u2014915 [85 Cal.Rptr.2d 909, 978 P.2d 67], internal citations omitted.)</li><li>\u201cAs to the first element of the common law tort, the defendant must have \u2018penetrated some zone of physical or sensory privacy . . . or obtained unwanted access to data\u2019 by electronic or other covert means, in violation of the law or social norms. In either instance, the expectation of privacy must be \u2018objectively reasonable.\u2019 In <i>Sanders</i> [<i>supra</i>, at p. 907] . . . , this court linked the reasonableness of privacy expectations to such factors as (1) the identity of the intruder, (2) the extent to which other persons had access to the subject place, and could see or hear the plaintiff, and (3) the means by which the intrusion occurred.\u201d (<i>Hernandez, supra</i>, 47 Cal.4th at pp. 286\u2014287.)</li><li>The plaintiff does not have to prove that he or she had a \u201ccomplete expectation of privacy\u201d: \u201cPrivacy for purposes of the intrusion tort must be evaluated with respect to the identity of the alleged intruder and the nature of the intrusion.\u201d (<i>Sanders, supra,</i> 20 Cal.4th at pp. 917\u2014918.)</li><li>\u201cThe second common law element essentially involves a \u2018policy\u2019 determination as to whether the alleged intrusion is \u2018highly offensive\u2019 under the particular circumstances. Relevant factors include the degree and setting of the intrusion, and the intruder\u2019s motives and objectives. Even in cases involving the use of photographic and electronic recording devices, which can raise difficult questions about covert surveillance, \u2018California tort law provides no bright line on [\u201coffensiveness\u201d]; each case must be taken on its facts.\u2019 \u201d (<i>Hernandez, supra</i>, 47 Cal. 4th at p. 287, internal citations omitted.)</li><li>\u201cWhile what is \u2018highly offensive to a reasonable person\u2019 suggests a standard upon which a jury would properly be instructed, there is a preliminary determination of \u2018offensiveness\u2019 which must be made by the court in discerning the existence of a cause of action for intrusion\u2026 A court determining the existence of \u2018offensiveness\u2019 would consider the degree of intrusion, the context, conduct and circumstances surrounding the intrusion as well as the intruder\u2019s motives and objectives, the setting into which he intrudes, and the expectations of those whose privacy is invaded.\u201d (<i>Miller v. National Broadcasting Co.</i> (1986) 187 Cal.App.3d 1463, 1483\u20141484 [232 Cal.Rptr. 668].)</li><li>\u201cPlaintiffs must show more than an intrusion upon reasonable privacy expectations. Actionable invasions of privacy also must be \u2018highly offensive\u2019 to a reasonable person, and \u2018sufficiently serious\u2019 and unwarranted as to constitute an \u2018egregious breach of the social norms.\u2019 \u201d (<i>Hernandez, supra</i>, 47 Cal.4th at p. 295, internal citation omitted.)</li><li>\u201c[L]iability under the intrusion tort requires that the invasion be highly offensive to a reasonable person, considering, among other factors, the motive of the alleged intruder.\u201d (<i>Sanders, supra,</i> 20 Cal.4th at p. 911, internal citations omitted.)</li><li>Damages flowing from an invasion of privacy \u201clogically would include an award for mental suffering and anguish.\u201d (<i>Miller, supra,</i> 187 Cal.App.3d at p. 1484, citing <i>Fairfield v. American Photocopy Equipment Co.</i> (1955) 138 Cal.App.2d 82 [291 P.2d 194].)</li><li>Related statutory actions can be brought for stalking (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1708.7), invasion of privacy to capture physical impression (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1708.8), and eavesdropping and wiretapping (Pen. Code, \u00a7 637.2). Civil Code section 1708.8 was enacted in 1998 as an anti-paparazzi measure. To date there are no reported cases based on this statute.</li></ul>",

When the value of the work comes principally from some source other than the fame of the celebrity\u2014from the creativity, skill, and reputation of the artist\u2014it may be presumed that sufficient transformative elements are present to warrant First Amendment protection. If the question is answered in the affirmative, however, it does not necessarily follow that the work is without First Amendment protection\u2014it may still be a transformative work.\u201d (<i>Comedy III Productions, Inc., supra,</i> 25 Cal.4th at p. 407.)</li><li>\u201cAs the Supreme Court has stated, the central purpose of the inquiry into this fair use factor \u2018is to see . . . whether the new work merely \u201csupersede[s] the objects\u201d of the original creation, or instead adds something new, with a further purpose or different character, altering the first with new expression, meaning, or message; it asks, in other words, whether and to what extent the new work is \u201ctransformative.\u201d \u2019 \u201d(<i>Comedy III Productions, Inc., supra,</i> 25 Cal.4th at p. 404, internal citations omitted.)</li><li>\u201cWe emphasize that the transformative elements or creative contributions that require First Amendment protection are not confined to parody and can take many forms, from factual reporting to fictionalized portrayal, from heavy-handed lampooning to subtle social criticism.\u201d (<i>Comedy III Productions, Inc., supra,</i> 25 Cal.4th at p. 406.)</li><li>\u201cThis \u2018transformative use\u2019 defense poses \u2018what is essentially a balancing test between the First Amendment and the right of publicity.\u2019 \u201d (<i>Hilton v. Hallmark Cards</i> (9th Cir. 2009) 580 F.3d 874, 889.)</li><li>\u201cThe application of the defense, which the California Supreme Court based loosely on the intersection of the First Amendment and copyright liability, depends upon \u2018whether the celebrity likeness is one of the \u201craw materials\u201d from which an original work is synthesized, or whether the depiction or imitation of the celebrity is the very sum and substance of the work in question.\u2019 In other words, \u2018[w]e ask . . . whether a product containing a celebrity\u2019s likeness is so transformed that it has become primarily the defendant\u2019s own expression rather than the celebrity\u2019s likeness. And when we use the word \u201cexpression,\u201d we mean expression of something other than the likeness of the celebrity.\u2019 \u2018[U]nder [this] test,\u2019 yet another formulation cautions, \u2018when an artist\u2019s skill and talent is manifestly subordinated to the overall goal of creating a conventional portrait of a celebrity so as to commercially exploit his or her fame, then the artist\u2019s right of free expression is outweighed by the right of publicity.\u2019 \u201d (<i>Hilton, supra</i>, 580 F.3d at p. 889, footnote and internal citations omitted.)</li><li>\u201cThe distinction between parody and other forms of literary expression is irrelevant to the <i>Comedy III</i> transformative test. It does not matter what precise literary category the work falls into. What matters is whether the work is transformative, not whether it is parody or satire or caricature or serious social commentary or any other specific form of expression.\u201d (<i>Winter, supra,</i> 30 Cal.4th at p. 891.)</li></ul>",

[S]uch a relationship can only come into being as a result of some sort of transaction between the parties\u2026 Thus, a duty to disclose may arise from the relationship between seller and buyer, employer and prospective employee, doctor and patient, or parties entering into any kind of contractual agreement.\u2019 All of these relationships are created by transactions between parties from which a duty to disclose facts material to the transaction arises under certain circumstances.\u201d (<i>Limandri v.

[however,] \u2018[t]he duty to disclose may arise without any confidential relationship where the defendant alone has knowledge of material facts which are not accessible to the plaintiff.\u2019 \u201d (<i>Magpali v. Farmers Group, Inc.</i> (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 471, 482 [55 Cal.Rptr.2d 225], internal citations omitted.)</li><li>\u201cIn transactions which do not involve fiduciary or confidential relations, a cause of action for non-disclosure of material facts may arise in at least three instances: (1) the defendant makes representations but does not disclose facts which materially qualify the facts disclosed, or which render his disclosure likely to mislead; (2) the facts are known or accessible only to defendant, and defendant knows they are not known to or reasonably discoverable by the plaintiff; (3) the defendant actively conceals discovery from the plaintiff.\u201d (<i>Warner Construction Corp. v.

For example, a duty to disclose may arise without a confidential or fiduciary relationship where the defendant, a real estate agent or broker, alone has knowledge of material facts which are not accessible to the plaintiff, a buyer of real property.\u201d (<i>La Jolla Village Homeowners\u2019 Assn. v.

        "sources_and_authority": "<ul><li>Civil Code section 3346(a) provides: \u201cFor wrongful injuries to timber, trees, or underwood upon the land of another, or removal thereof, the measure of damages is three times such sum as would compensate for the actual detriment, except that where the trespass was casual or involuntary, or that the defendant in any action brought under this section had probable cause to believe that the land on which the trespass was committed was his own or the land of the person in whose service or by whose direction the act was done, the measure of damages shall be twice the sum as would compensate for the actual detriment, and excepting further that where the wood was taken by the authority of highway officers for the purpose of repairing a public highway or bridge upon the land or adjoining it, in which case judgment shall only be given in a sum equal to the actual detriment.\u201d</li><li>Code of Civil Procedure section 733 provides, in part: \u201cAny person who cuts down or carries off any wood or underwood, tree, or timber . . . or otherwise injures any tree or timber on the land of another person . . . is liable to the owner of such land . . . for treble the amount of damages which may be assessed therefor, in a civil action, in any Court having jurisdiction.\u201d</li><li>The damages provisions in sections 3346 and 733 must be \u201ctreated as penal and punitive.\u201d (<i>Baker v. Ramirez</i> (1987) 190 Cal.App.3d 1123, 1138 [235 Cal.Rptr. 857], internal citation omitted.)</li><li>\u201c \u2018However, due to the penal nature of these provisions, the damages should be neither doubled nor tripled under section 3346 if punitive damages are awarded under section 3294. That would amount to punishing the defendant twice and is not necessary to further the policy behind section 3294 of educating blunderers (persons who mistake location of boundary lines) and discouraging rogues (persons who ignore boundary lines).\u2019 \u201d (<i>Hassoldt v. Patrick Media Group, Inc.</i> (2000) 84 Cal.App.4th 153, 169 [100 Cal.Rptr.2d 662], internal citations omitted.)</li><li>\u201cAlthough an award of double the actual damages is mandatory under section 3346, the court retains discretion whether to triple them under that statute or Code of Civil Procedure section 733. [\u00b6] \u2018So, the effect of section 3346 as amended, read together with section 733, is that the Legislature intended, insofar as wilful and malicious trespass is concerned under either section, to leave the imposition of treble damages discretionary with the court, but to place a floor upon that discretion at double damages which must be applied whether the trespass be wilful and malicious or casual and involuntary, etc. There are now three measures of damages applicable to the pertinent types of trespass: (1) for wilful and malicious trespass the court may impose treble damages but must impose double damages; (2) for casual and involuntary trespass, etc., the court must impose double damages; and (3) for trespass under authority actual damages.\u2019 \u201d (<i>Ostling</i>, <i>supra</i>, 27 Cal.App.4th at p. 1742, internal citation omitted.)</li><li>\u201cTreble damages could only be awarded under [section 3346] where the wrongdoer intentionally acted wilfully or maliciously. The required intent is one to vex, harass or annoy, and the existence of such intent is a question of fact for the trial court.\u201d (<i>Sills v. Siller</i> (1963) 218 Cal.App.2d 735, 743 [32 Cal.Rptr. 621], internal citation omitted.)</li><li>\u201cAlthough neither section [3346 or 733] expressly so provides, it is now settled that to warrant such an award of treble damages it must be established that the wrongful act was willful and malicious.\u201d (<i>Caldwell v. Walker</i> (1963) 211 Cal.App.2d 758, 762 [27 Cal.Rptr. 675], internal citations omitted.)</li><li>\u201cA proper and helpful analogue here is the award of exemplary damages under section 3294 of the Civil Code when a defendant has been guilty, inter alia, of \u2018malice, express or implied.\u2019 . . . \u2018In order to warrant the allowance of such damages the act complained of must not only be wilful, in the sense of intentional, but it must be accompanied by some aggravating circumstance, amounting to malice. Malice implies an act conceived in a spirit of mischief or with criminal indifference towards the obligations owed to others. There must be an intent to vex, annoy or injure. Mere spite or ill will is not sufficient.\u2019 . . . Malice may consist of a state of mind determined to perform an act with reckless or wanton disregard of or indifference to the rights of others. Since a defendant rarely admits to such a state of mind, it must frequently be established from the circumstances surrounding his allegedly malicious acts.\u201d (<i>Caldwell, supra</i>, 211 Cal.App.2d at pp. 763\u2014764, internal citations omitted.)</li><li>\u201cUnder [Health and Safety Code] section 13007, a tortfeasor generally is liable to the owner of property for damage caused by a negligently set fire. \u2018[T]he statute places no restrictions on the type of property damage that is compensable.\u2019 Such damages might include, for example, damage to structures, to movable personal property, to soil, or to undergrowth; damages may even include such elements as the lost profits of a business damaged by fire. If the fire also damages trees\u2014that is, causes \u2018injuries to . . . trees . . . upon the land of another\u2019\u2014then the actual damages recoverable under section 13007 may be doubled (for negligently caused fires) or trebled (for fires intended to spread to the plaintiff\u2019s property) pursuant to section 3346.\u201d (<i>Kelly v.

The activity in issue must \u2018disturb or prevent the comfortable enjoyment of property,\u2019 such as smoke from an asphalt mixing plant, noise and odors from the operation of a refreshment stand, or the noise and vibration of machinery.\u201d (<i>Oliver v.

A nuisance may be both public and private, but to proceed on a private nuisance theory the plaintiff must prove an injury specifically referable to the use and enjoyment of his or her land. The injury, however, need not be different in kind from that suffered by the general public.\u201d (<i>Koll-Irvine Center Property Owners Assn. v. County of Orange</i> (1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 1036, 1041 [29 Cal.Rptr.2d 664], internal citation omitted.)</li><li>\u201cExamples of interferences with the use and enjoyment of land actionable under a private nuisance theory are legion. \u2018So long as the interference is substantial and unreasonable, and such as would be offensive or inconvenient to the normal person, virtually any disturbance of the enjoyment of the property may amount to a nuisance.\u2019 \u201d (<i>Koll-Irvine Center Property Owners Assn., supra,</i> 24 Cal.App.4th at p. 1041, internal citation omitted.)</li><li>\u201cThe first additional requirement for recovery of damages on a nuisance theory is proof that the invasion of the plaintiff\u2019s interest in the use and enjoyment of the land was substantial, i.e., that it caused the plaintiff to suffer \u2018substantial actual damage.\u2019 The Restatement recognizes the same requirement as the need for proof of \u2018significant harm,\u2019 which it variously defines as \u2018harm of importance\u2019 and a \u2018real and appreciable invasion of the plaintiff\u2019s interests\u2019 and an invasion that is \u2018definitely offensive, seriously annoying or intolerable.\u2019 The degree of harm is to be judged by an objective standard, i.e., what effect would the invasion have on persons of normal health and sensibilities living in the same community? \u2018If normal persons in that locality would not be substantially annoyed or disturbed by the situation, then the invasion is not a significant one, even though the idiosyncrasies of the particular plaintiff may make it unendurable to him.\u2019 This is, of course, a question of fact that turns on the circumstances of each case.\u201d (<i>San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co., supra,</i> 13 Cal.4th at p. 938, internal citations omitted.)</li><li>\u201cThe second additional requirement for nuisance is superficially similar but analytically distinct: \u2018The interference with the protected interest must not only be substantial, but it must also be unreasonable\u2019, i.e., it must be \u2018of such a nature, duration or amount as to constitute unreasonable interference with the use and enjoyment of the land.\u2019 The primary test for determining whether the invasion is unreasonable is whether the gravity of the harm outweighs the social utility of the defendant\u2019s conduct, taking a number of factors into account. Again the standard is objective: the question is not whether the particular plaintiff found the invasion unreasonable, but \u2018whether reasonable persons generally, looking at the whole situation impartially and objectively, would consider it unreasonable.\u2019 And again this is a question of fact: \u2018Fundamentally, the unreasonableness of intentional invasions is a problem of relative values to be determined by the trier of fact in each case in the light of all the circumstances of that case.\u2019 \u201d (<i>San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co., supra,</i> 13 Cal.4th at pp. 938\u2014939, internal citations omitted.)</li><li>Appellant first argues that the judgment is erroneous because there is no showing that any act or conduct of his caused the damage. It is true that there is neither showing nor finding of any negligent or wrongful act or omission of defendant proximately causing the falling of the trees. But no such showing is required.

A permanent trespass is an intrusion on property under circumstances that indicate an intention that the trespass shall be permanent. In these cases, the law considers the wrong to be completed at the time of entry and allows recovery of damages for past, present, and future harm in a single action, generally the diminution in the property\u2019s value. The cause of action accrues and the statute of limitations begins to run at the time of entry\u2026 [\u00b6] In contrast, a continuing trespass is an intrusion under circumstances that indicate the trespass may be discontinued or abated. In these circumstances, damages are assessed for present and past damages only; prospective damages are not awarded because the trespass may be discontinued or abated at some time, ending the harm\u2026 Continuing trespasses are essentially a series of successive injuries, and the statute of limitations begins anew with each injury. In order to recover for all harm inflicted by a continuing trespass, the plaintiff is required to bring periodic successive actions.\u201d (<i>Starrh &amp; Starrh Cotton Growers, supra,</i> 153 Cal.App.4th at p. 592.)</li><li>\u201cTwo distinct classifications have emerged in nuisance law which determine the remedies available to injured parties and the applicable statute of limitations. On the one hand, permanent nuisances are of a type where \u2018by one act a permanent injury is done, [and] damages are assessed once for all.\u2019 . . . In such cases, plaintiffs ordinarily are required to bring one action for all past, present and future damage within three years after the permanent nuisance is erected. The statutory period is shorter for claims against public entities. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 911.2.) Damages are not dependent upon any subsequent use of the property but are complete when the nuisance comes into existence. [\u00b6] On the other hand, if a nuisance is a use which may be discontinued at any time, it is considered continuing in character and persons harmed by it may bring successive actions for damages until the nuisance is abated. Recovery is limited, however, to actual injury suffered prior to commencement of each action. Prospective damages are unavailable.\u201d (<i>Baker v. Burbank-Glendale- Pasadena Airport Auth.</i> (1985) 39 Cal.3d 862, 868\u2014869 [218 Cal.Rptr. 293, 705 P.2d 866], internal citations and footnotes omitted.)</li><li>\u201cHistorically, the application of the statute of limitations for trespass has been the same as for nuisance and has depended on whether the trespass has been continuing or permanent.\u201d (<i>Mangini v. Aerojet-General Corp.</i> (1991) 230 Cal.App.3d 1125, 1148 [281 Cal.Rptr. 827].)</li><li>\u201c[G]enerally the principles governing the permanent or continuing nature of a trespass or nuisance are the same and the cases discuss the two causes of action without distinction.\u201d (<i>Starrh &amp; Starrh Cotton Growers, supra,</i> 153 Cal.App.4th at p. 594.)</li><li>\u201cGenerally, whether a trespass is continuing or permanent is a question of fact properly submitted to the jury. A trial court may remove the issue of fact from the jury by directed verdict only if there is no evidence tending to prove the case of the party opposing the motion.\u201d (<i>Starrh &amp; Starrh Cotton Growers, supra,</i> 153 Cal.App.4th at p. 597, internal citations omitted.)</li><li>\u201c[T]he key question [in determining whether a trespass is continuous or permanent] is whether the trespass or nuisance can be discontinued or abated and there are a number of tests used to answer this question. A respected legal treatise summarizes the various tests as follows: \u2018[W]hether (1) the offense activity is currently continuing, which indicates that the nuisance is continuing, (2) the impact of the condition will vary over time, indicating a continuing nuisance, or (3) the nuisance can be abated at any time, in a reasonable manner and for reasonable cost, and is feasible by comparison of the benefits and detriments to be gained by abatement.\u2019 \u201d (<i>Starrh &amp; Starrh Cotton Growers, supra,</i> 153 Cal.App.4th at pp. 593\u2014594, citing 8 Miller &amp; Starr, Cal. Real Estate (3d ed. 2000) \u00a7 22.39, pp. 148\u2014149.)</li><li>\u201cThe jury\u2019s conclusion that it was unknown whether the soil contamination could be abated by reasonable means at a reasonable cost means that plaintiff had failed to prove her claims of continuing nuisance and trespass.\u201d (<i>McCoy v. Gustafson</i> (2009) 180 Cal.App.4th 56, 86 [103 Cal.Rptr.3d 37].)</li><li>\u201c[T]he \u2018continuing\u2019 nature of a nuisance \u2018refers to the continuing damage caused by the offensive condition, not to the acts causing the offensive condition to occur.\u2019 \u201d (<i>Lyles, supra,</i> 153 Cal.App.4th at p. 291, internal citation omitted.)</li><li>\u201c[A] cause of action for damage to real property accrues when the defendant\u2019s act causes \u2018 <i>immediate and permanent</i> injury\u2019 to the property or, to put it another way, when there is \u2018[a]ctual and appreciable harm\u2019 to the property.\u201d (<i>Siegel v. Anderson Homes, Inc.</i> (2004) 118 Cal.App.4th 994, 1005 [13 Cal.Rptr.3d 462], original italics, internal citations omitted.)</li><li>\u201cProperty damage cases . . . are different from medical malpractice cases in the sense that, when property is damaged, there is ordinarily some wrongful cause. Thus, when one\u2019s property is damaged, one should reasonably suspect that someone has done something wrong to him and, accordingly, be charged with knowledge of the information that would have been revealed by an investigation. That particular property damage could result from natural causes does not mean that the same property damage could result only from natural causes.\u201d (<i>Lyles, supra,</i> 153 Cal.App.4th at pp. 287\u2014288.)</li><li>\u201cThe traditional rule in tort cases is that the statute of limitations begins to run upon the <i>occurrence</i> of the last fact essential to the cause of action. Although sometimes harsh, the fact that plaintiff is neither aware of his cause of action nor of the identity of a wrongdoer will not toll the statute. [\u00b6] The harshness of this rule has been ameliorated in some cases where it is manifestly unjust to deprive plaintiffs of a cause of action before they are aware that they have been injured. This modified rule has been applied to latent defects in real property and improvements. In the case of such latent defects the statute of limitations begins to run only when \u2018noticeable damage occurs.\u2019 \u201d (<i>Leaf v. City of San Mateo</i> (1980) 104 Cal.App.3d 398, 406\u2014407 [163 Cal.Rptr. 711], internal citations omitted, disapproved on another ground in <i>Trope v.

Petersen</i> (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 1062, 1066 [80 Cal.Rptr.2d 704], internal citations omitted.)</li><li>\u201c[I]t is generally acknowledged that conversion is a tort that may be committed only with relation to personal property and not real property.\u201d (<i>Munger v. Moore</i> (1970) 11 Cal.App.3d 1, 7 [89 Cal.Rptr. 323], disagreeing with <i>Katz v. Enos</i> (1945) 68 Cal.App.2d 266, 269 [156 P.2d 461].)</li><li>\u201cThe first element of that cause of action is his ownership or right to possession of the property at the time of the conversion. Once it is determined that [plaintiff] has a right to reinstate the contract, he has a right to possession of the vehicle and standing to bring conversion. Unjustified refusal to turn over possession on demand constitutes conversion even where possession by the withholder was originally obtained lawfully and of course so does an unauthorized sale.\u201d (<i>Cerra v. Blackstone</i> (1985) 172 Cal.App.3d 604, 609 [218 Cal.Rptr. 15], internal citations omitted.)</li><li>\u201c \u2018To establish a conversion, plaintiff must establish an actual interference with his ownership or right of possession. . . . Where plaintiff neither has title to the property alleged to have been converted, nor possession<br/>thereof, he cannot maintain an action for conversion.\u2019 \u201d (<i>Moore v. Regents of the Univ. of Cal.</i> (1990) 51 Cal.3d 120, 136 [271 Cal.Rptr. 146, 793<br/>P.2d 479], internal citations omitted.)</li><li>\u201cIn a conversion action the plaintiff need show only that he was entitled to possession at the time of conversion; the fact that plaintiff regained possession of the converted property does not prevent him from suing for damages for the conversion.\u201d (<i>Enterprise Leasing Corp. v. Shugart Corp</i>. (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 737, 748 [282 Cal.Rptr. 620], internal citation omitted.)</li><li>\u201cNeither legal title nor absolute ownership of the property is necessary. . . . A party need only allege it is \u2018entitled to immediate possession at the time of conversion. . . . \u2019 . . . However, a mere contractual right of payment, without more, will not suffice.\u201d (<i>Plummer</i>, <i>supra</i>, 184 Cal.App.4th at p. 45, internal citation omitted.)</li><li>\u201cThe existence of a lien . . . can establish the immediate right to possess needed for conversion. \u2018One who holds property by virtue of a lien upon it may maintain an action for conversion if the property was wrongfully disposed of by the owner and without authority . . . .\u2019 Thus, attorneys may maintain conversion actions against those who wrongfully withhold or disburse funds subject to their attorney\u2019s liens.\u201d (<i>Plummer</i>, <i>supra</i>, 184 Cal.App.4th at p. 45, internal citation omitted.)</li><li>\u201cWhere the conduct complained of does not amount to a substantial interference with possession or the right thereto, but consists of intermeddling with or use of or damages to the personal property, the owner has a cause of action for trespass or case, and may recover only the actual damages suffered by reason of the impairment of the property or the loss of its use. As [plaintiff] was a cotenant and had the right of possession of the realty, which included the right to keep his personal property thereon, [defendant]\u2019s act of placing the goods in storage, although not constituting the assertion of ownership and a substantial interference with possession to the extent of a conversion, amounted to an intermeddling. Therefore, [plaintiff] is entitled to actual damages in an amount sufficient to compensate him for any impairment of the property<br/>or loss of its use.\u201d (<i>Zaslow v. Kroenert</i> (1946) 29 Cal.2d 541, 551\u2013552 [176 P.2d 1], internal citation omitted.)</li><li>\u201c[T]he law is well settled that there can be no conversion where an owner either expressly or impliedly assents to or ratifies the taking, use or disposition of his property.\u201d (<i>Farrington v. A. Teichert &amp; Son, Inc.</i> (1943) 59 Cal.App.2d 468, 474 [139 P.2d 80], internal citations omitted.)</li><li>\u201cAs to intentional invasions of the plaintiff\u2019s interests, his consent negatives the wrongful element of the defendant\u2019s act, and prevents the existence of a tort. \u2018The absence of lawful consent,\u2019 said Mr. Justice Holmes, \u2018is part of the definition of an assault.\u2019 The same is true of false imprisonment, conversion, and trespass.\u201d (<i>Tavernier v. Maes</i> (1966) 242 Cal.App.2d 532, 552 [51 Cal.Rptr. 575], internal citations omitted.)</li><li>\u201c \u2018Money cannot be the subject of a cause of action for conversion unless there is a specific, identifiable sum involved, such as where an agent accepts a sum of money to be paid to another and fails to make the payment.\u2019 A \u2018generalized claim for money [is] not actionable as conversion.\u2019 \u201d (<i>PCO, Inc. v. Christensen, Miller, Fink, Jacobs, Glaser, Weil &amp; Shapiro, LLP</i> (2007) 150 Cal.App.4th 384, 395 [58 Cal.Rptr.3d<br/>516], internal citations omitted.)</li><li>\u201cOne who buys property in good faith from a party lacking title and the right to sell may be liable for conversion. The remedies for conversion include specific recovery of the property, damages, and a quieting of title.\u201d (<i>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Department of Motor Vehicles</i> (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 1076, 1081\u20131082 [62 Cal.Rptr.2d 178], internal citations omitted.)</li><li>\u201c[Conversion] must be knowingly or intentionally done, but a wrongful intent is not necessary. Because the act must be knowingly done, \u2018neither negligence, active or passive, nor a breach of contract, even though it result in injury to, or loss of, specific property, constitutes a conversion.\u2019 It follows therefore that mistake, good faith, and due care are ordinarily immaterial, and cannot be set up as defenses in an action for conversion.\u201d (<i>Taylor v. Forte Hotels International</i> (1991) 235 Cal.App.3d 1119, 1124 [1 Cal.Rptr.2d 189], internal citations omitted.)</li><li>\u201cIn order to establish a conversion, the plaintiff \u2018must show an intention or purpose to convert the goods and to exercise ownership over them, or to prevent the owner from taking possession of his property.\u2019 Thus, a necessary element of the tort is an intent to exercise ownership over property which belongs to another. For this reason, conversion is considered an intentional tort.\u201d (<i>Collin v. American Empire Insurance Co.</i> (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 787, 812 [26 Cal.Rptr.2d 391], internal citations omitted.)</li><li>\u201cA conversion can occur when a willful failure to return property deprives the owner of possession.\u201d (<i>Fearon v. Department of Corrections</i> (1984) 162 Cal.App.3d 1254, 1257 [209 Cal.Rptr. 309], internal citation omitted.)</li><li>\u201cA demand for return of the property is not a condition precedent to institution of the action when possession was originally acquired by a tort as it was in this case.\u201d (<i>Igauye v. Howard</i> (1952) 114 Cal.App.2d 122, 127 [249 P.2d 558].)</li><li>\u201c \u2018Negligence in caring for the goods is not an act of dominion over them such as is necessary to make the bailee liable as a converter.\u2019 Thus a warehouseman\u2019s negligence in causing a fire which destroyed the plaintiffs\u2019 goods will not support a conversion claim.\u201d (<i>Gonzales v. Pers. Storage Inc.</i> (1997) 56 Cal.App.4th 464, 477 [65 Cal.Rptr.2d 473], internal citations omitted.)</li><li>\u201cAlthough damages for conversion are frequently the equivalent to the damages for negligence, i.e., specific recovery of the property or damages based on the value of the property, negligence is no part of an action for conversion.\u201d (<i>Taylor, supra</i>, 235 Cal.App.3d at p. 1123, internal citation omitted.)</li><li>\u201cA person without legal title to property may recover from a converter if the plaintiff is responsible to the true owner, such as in the case of a bailee or pledgee of the property.\u201d (<i>Department of Industrial Relations v.

List</i> (1938) 11 Cal.2d 389, 393 [79 P.2d 1087].)</li><li>\u201cAlthough the first part of section 3336 appears to provide for alternative measures of recovery, the first of the two measures, namely the value of the property converted at the time and place of conversion with interest from that time, is generally considered to be the appropriate measure of damages in a conversion action. The determination of damages under the alternative provision is resorted to only where the determination on the basis of value at the time of conversion would be manifestly unjust.\u201d (<i>Myers v. Stephens</i> (1965) 233 Cal.App.2d 104, 116 [43 Cal.Rptr. 420], internal citations omitted.)</li><li>\u201cAs a general rule, the value of the converted property is the appropriate measure of damages, and resort to the alternative occurs only where a determination of damages on the basis of value would be manifestly unjust. Accordingly, a person claiming damages under the alternative provision must plead and prove special circumstances that require a measure of damages other than value, and the jury must determine whether it was reasonably foreseeable that special injury or damage would result from the conversion.\u201d (<i>Lueter v. State of California</i> (2002) 94 Cal.App.4th 1285, 1302 [115 Cal.Rptr.2d 68], internal citations omitted.)</li><li>\u201cThe damage measures set forth in the first paragraph of section 3336 are in the alternative. The first alternative is to compensate for the value of the property at the time of conversion with interest from the time of the taking. The second alternative is compensation in a sum equal to the amount of loss legally caused by the conversion and which could have been avoided with a proper degree of prudence. Both of these alternatives are in addition to the damage element for the time spent pursuing the converted property set forth in the second paragraph of section 3336.\u201d (<i>Moreno v. Greenwood Auto Center</i> (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 201, 209 [110 Cal.Rptr.2d 177], internal citations omitted.)</li><li>\u201cCivil Code section 3336 sets out the presumptive measure of damages in conversion, which is rebuttable, save and except when section 3337 applies. Under Civil Code section 3337, a defendant cannot rebut the presumption by claiming that he applied the converted property to plaintiff\u2019s benefit when he took unlawful possession of the property from the beginning. Consequently, the effect of section 3337 is to prevent mitigation when property is stolen from the plaintiff and subsequently applied to his benefit. In this situation, the defendant will not be able to claim that his conversion benefited plaintiff; he will thereby be prevented from claiming an offset derived from his original wrong. In contrast to this situation, if the particular facts of a case indicate, as in the instant case, that the possession was lawful before the conversion occurred . . . Civil Code section 3337 is inapplicable, and a converter is not precluded from claiming mitigation of damages.\u201d (<i>Dakota Gardens Apartment Investors \u201cB\u201d v.

However, where proof establishes an injury beyond that which would be adequately compensated by the value of the property and interest, the court may award such amounts as will indemnify for all proximate reasonable loss caused by the wrongful act. Where damages for loss of use exceeds the legal rate of interest, it is appropriate to award the former, but not both.\u201d (<i>Lint v.

Although no California case which has applied the alternative measure of damages in a conversion case has specifically defined this language, we are satisfied that its meaning is synonymous with the term \u2018proximate cause\u2019 or \u2018legal cause.\u2019 These terms mean, in essence, \u2018that there be some reasonable connection between the act or omission of the defendant and the damage which the plaintiff has suffered.\u2019 In determining whether this connection exists, the question is whether it was reasonably foreseeable to a prudent person, having regard for the accompanying circumstances, that injury or damage would likely result from his wrongful act.

It is not necessary to prove that the defendant acted with the specific intent, or purpose, of disrupting the plaintiff\u2019s prospective economic advantage. Instead, \u2018it is sufficient for the plaintiff to plead that the defendant \u201c[knew] that the interference is certain or substantially certain to occur as a result of his action.\u201d \u2019 \u2018[A]n act is independently wrongful if it is unlawful, that is, if it is proscribed by some constitutional, statutory, regulatory, common law, or other determinable legal standard.\u2019 \u2018[A]n act must be wrongful by some legal measure, rather than merely a product of an improper, but lawful, purpose or motive.\u2019 \u201d (<i>San Jose Construction, Inc. v.

If that same party cannot conspire with a third party to breach or interfere with his or her own contract then certainly the result should be no different where the \u2018conspiracy\u2019 is to disrupt a relationship which has not even risen to the dignity of an existing contract and the party to that relationship was entirely free to \u2018disrupt\u2019 it on his or her own without legal restraint or penalty.\u201d (<i>Kasparian v. County of Los Angeles</i> (1995) 38 Cal.App.4th 242, 266 [45 Cal.Rptr.2d 90], original italics.)</li><li>\u201cAlthough varying language has been used to express this threshold requirement, the cases generally agree it must be reasonably probable that the prospective economic advantage would have been realized but for defendant\u2019s interference.\u201d (<i>Youst, supra,</i> 43 Cal.3d at p. 71, internal citations omitted.)</li><li>\u201c[A] plaintiff seeking to recover for an alleged interference with prospective contractual or economic relations must plead and prove as part of its case-in-chief that the defendant not only knowingly interfered with the plaintiff\u2019s expectancy, but engaged in conduct that was wrongful by some legal measure other than the fact of interference itself.\u201d (<i>Della Penna</i>, <i>supra</i>, 11 Cal.4th at p. 393.)</li><li>\u201c<i>Della Penna</i> did not specify what sort of conduct would qualify as \u2018wrongful\u2019 apart from the interference itself.\u201d (<i>Limandri v.

The Oregon Supreme Court suggests that conduct may be wrongful if it violates \u2018a statute or other regulation, or a recognized rule of common law, or perhaps an established standard of a trade or profession.\u2019 . . . Our Supreme Court may later have occasion to clarify the meaning of \u2018wrongful conduct\u2019 or \u2018wrongfulness,\u2019 or it may be that a precise definition proves impossible.\u201d (<i>Arntz Contracting Co. v. St. Paul Fire and Marine Insurance Co.</i> (1996) 47 Cal.App.4th 464, 477\u2014478 [54 Cal.Rptr.2d 888], internal citations omitted.)</li><li>\u201cCommonly included among improper means are actions which are independently actionable, violations of federal or state law or unethical business practices, e.g., violence, misrepresentation, unfounded litigation, defamation, trade libel or trade mark infringement.\u201d (<i>PMC, Inc., supra,</i> 45 Cal.App.4th at p. 603, internal citation omitted.)</li><li>\u201cIt is insufficient to allege the defendant engaged in tortious conduct distinct from or only tangentially related to the conduct constituting the actual interference.\u201d (<i>Limandri, supra,</i> 52 Cal.App.4th at p. 342.)</li><li>\u201c[O]ur focus for determining the wrongfulness of those intentional acts should be on the defendant\u2019s objective conduct, and evidence of motive or other subjective states of mind is relevant only to illuminating the nature of that conduct.\u201d (<i>Arntz Contracting Co., supra,</i> 47 Cal.App.4th at p. 477.)</li><li>\u201cSince the crux of the competition privilege is that one can interfere with a competitor\u2019s prospective contractual relationship with a third party as long as the interfering conduct is not independently wrongful (i.e., wrongful apart from the fact of the interference itself), <i>Della Penna</i>\u2019s requirement that a plaintiff plead and prove such wrongful conduct in order to recover for intentional interference with prospective economic advantage has resulted in a shift of burden of proof. It is now the plaintiff\u2019s burden to prove, as an element of the cause of action itself, that the defendant\u2019s conduct was independently wrongful and, therefore, was not privileged rather than the defendant\u2019s burden to prove, as an affirmative defense, that it\u2019s [<i>sic</i>] conduct was not independently wrongful and therefore was privileged.\u201d (<i>Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond of La Jolla, Inc. v.

If it does, then the issue is one for the fact finder to decide.\u201d (<i>Overhill Farms, Inc. v.

Superior Court</i> (1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 764, 786 [69 Cal.Rptr.2d 466].)</li><li>\u201c \u2018The tort of negligent interference with economic relationship arises only when the defendant owes the plaintiff a duty of care.\u2019 \u201d (<i>Limandri v.

Gregory</i> (1979) 24 Cal.3d 799, 804 [157 Cal.Rptr. 407, 598 P.2d 60].)</li><li>The trial court should instruct the jury on the \u201cindependently wrongful\u201d element of the tort of negligent interference with prospective economic advantage. (<i>National Medical Transportation Network v. Deloitte &amp; Touche</i> (1998) 62 Cal.App.4th 412, 440 [72 Cal.Rptr.2d 720].)</li><li>\u201cCommonly included among improper means are actions which are independently actionable, violations of federal or state law or unethical business practices, e.g., violence, misrepresentation, unfounded litigation, defamation, trade libel or trade mark infringement.\u201d (<i>PMC, Inc., supra,</i> 45 Cal.App.4th at p. 603, internal citation omitted.)</li><li>\u201cWhile the trial court and [defendant] are correct that a defendant incurs liability for interfering with another\u2019s prospective economic advantage only if the defendant\u2019s conduct was independently wrongful, we have been directed to no California authority, and have found none, for the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the wrongful conduct must be intentional or willful. The defendant\u2019s conduct must \u2018fall outside the boundaries of fair competition\u2019. . . , but negligent misconduct or the violation of a statutory obligation suffice. The approved CACI No. 2204 does not indicate otherwise and, in fact, indicates that either a misrepresentation or \u2018violation of statute\u2019 is sufficient.\u201d (<i>Venhaus v. Shultz</i> (2007) 155 Cal.App.4th 1072, 1079\u20141080 [66 Cal.Rptr.3d 432], internal citations omitted.)</li><li>Notably, one of \u201c[t]he criteria for establishing [the existence of] a duty of care is the \u2018blameworthiness\u2019 of the defendant\u2019s conduct.\u201d (<i>Lange v. TIG Insurance Co.</i> (1999) 68 Cal.App.4th 1179, 1187 [81 Cal.Rptr.2d 39].) The <i>Lange</i> court stated that in a negligent interference case \u201ca defendant\u2019s conduct is blameworthy only if it was independently wrongful apart from the interference itself.\u201d (<i>Ibid</i>.) Thus, the \u201cindependently wrongful\u201d element may, in effect, be decided by the judge in the course of determining whether a duty of care was owed.</li><li>There is currently no cause of action for negligent interference with contractual relations (see <i>Fifield Manor v. Finston</i> (1960) 54 Cal.2d 632, 636\u2014637 [7 Cal.Rptr. 377, 354 P.2d 1073]): \u201cAlthough the continuing validity of the so-called \u2018<i>Fifield</i> rule\u2019 is questionable in light of the California Supreme Court\u2019s recognition in <i>J\u2019Aire</i> of a cause of action for negligent interference with prospective economic advantage, the Supreme Court has yet to disapprove <i>Fifield</i>.\u201d (<i>LiMandri, supra,</i> 52 Cal.App.4th at p. 349.)</li><li>\u201cUnder the privilege of free competition, a competitor is free to divert business to himself as long as he uses fair and reasonable means. Thus, the plaintiff must present facts indicating the defendant\u2019s interference is somehow wrongful\u2014i.e., based on facts that take the defendant\u2019s actions out of the realm of legitimate business transactions.\u201d (<i>Tri-Growth Centre City, Ltd. v. Silldorf, Burdman, Duignan &amp; Eisenberg</i> (1989) 216 Cal.App.3d 1139, 1153\u20141154 [265 Cal.Rptr. 330], internal citations omitted.)</li><li>\u201cSince the crux of the competition privilege is that one can interfere with a competitor\u2019s prospective contractual relationship with a third party as long as the interfering conduct is not independently wrongful (i.e., wrongful apart from the fact of the interference itself), <i>Della Penna</i>\u2019s requirement that a plaintiff plead and prove such wrongful conduct in order to recover for intentional interference with prospective economic advantage has resulted in a shift of burden of proof. It is now the plaintiff\u2019s burden to prove, as an element of the cause of action itself, that the defendant\u2019s conduct was independently wrongful and, therefore, was not privileged rather than the defendant\u2019s burden to prove, as an affirmative defense, that it\u2019s [<i>sic</i>] conduct was not independently wrongful and therefore was privileged.\u201d (<i>Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond of La Jolla, Inc. v. La Jolla Village Square Venture Partners</i> (1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 867, 881 [60 Cal.Rptr.2d 830].)</li><li>There are other privileges that a defendant could assert in appropriate cases, such as the \u201cmanager\u2019s privilege.\u201d (See <i>Halvorsen v. Aramark Uniform Services, Inc.</i> (1998) 65 Cal.App.4th 1383, 1391\u20141392 [77 Cal.Rptr.2d 383].)</li></ul>",

That means insureds cannot unilaterally settle a claim before the establishment of the claim against them and the insurer\u2019s refusal to defend in a lawsuit to establish liability \u2026 [T]he decision to pay any remediation costs outside the civil action context raises a \u2018judgment call left solely to the insurer.\u2019 In short, the provision protects against coverage by fait accompli.\u201d <i>Low v.

Traders &amp; General Ins. Co.</i> (1958) 50 Cal.2d 654, 658 [328 P.2d 198].)</li><li>\u201cFor the insurer to fulfill its obligation not to impair the right of the insured to receive the benefits of the agreement, it again must give at least as much consideration to the latter\u2019s interests as it does to its own.\u201d (<i>Egan v. Mutual of Omaha Insurance Co.</i> (1979) 24 Cal.3d 809, 818\u2014819 [169 Cal.Rptr. 691, 620 P.2d 141].)</li><li>\u201c[T]o establish the insurer\u2019s \u2018bad faith\u2019 liability, the insured must show that the insurer has (1) withheld benefits due under the policy, and (2) that such withholding was \u2018unreasonable\u2019 or \u2018without proper cause.\u2019 The actionable withholding of benefits may consist of the denial of benefits due; paying less than due; and/or unreasonably delaying payments due.\u201d (<i>Major v. Western Home Ins.

[A]n insured plaintiff need only show, for example, that the insurer unreasonably refused to pay benefits or failed to accept a reasonable settlement offer; there is no requirement to establish subjective bad faith.\u201d (<i>Bosetti v. United States Life Ins.

There must be proof the insurer failed or refused to discharge its contractual duties not because of an honest mistake, bad judgment, or negligence, \u2018but rather by a conscious and deliberate act, which unfairly frustrates the agreed common purposes and disappoints the reasonable expectations of the other party thereby depriving that party of the benefits of the agreement.\u2019 \u201d (<i>Century Surety Co. v. Polisso</i> (2006) 139 Cal.App.4th 922, 949 [43 Cal.Rptr.3d 468], internal citations omitted.)</li><li>\u201c[I]f the insurer denies benefits unreasonably (i.e., without any reasonable basis for such denial), it may be exposed to the full array of tort remedies, including possible punitive damages.\u201d (<i>Jordan v.

But the obligation goes further: bad faith may be overt or may consist of inaction, and fair dealing may require more than honesty. A complete catalogue of types of bad faith is impossible, but the following types are among those which have been recognized in judicial decisions: evasion of the spirit of the bargain, lack of diligence and slacking off, willful rendering of imperfect performance, abuse of a power to specify terms, and interference with or failure to cooperate in the other party\u2019s performance.\u201d (<i>R. J. Kuhl Corp. v. Sullivan</i> (1993) 13 Cal.App.4th 1589, 1602 [17 Cal.Rptr.2d 425].)</li><li>\u201c[A]n insurer is not required to pay every claim presented to it. Besides the duty to deal fairly with the insured, the insurer also has a duty to its other policyholders and to the stockholders (if it is such a company) not to dissipate its reserves through the payment of meritless claims. Such a practice inevitably would prejudice the insurance seeking public because of the necessity to increase rates, and would finally drive the insurer out of business.\u201d (<i>Austero v. National Cas. Co.</i> (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 1, 30 [148 Cal.Rptr. 653], overruled on other grounds in <i>Egan, supra,</i> 24 Cal.3d at p. 824 fn. 7.)</li><li>\u201cUnique obligations are imposed upon true fiduciaries which are not found in the insurance relationship. For example, a true fiduciary must first consider and always act in the best interests of its trust and not allow self-interest to overpower its duty to act in the trust\u2019s best interests. An insurer, however, may give its own interests consideration equal to that it gives the interests of its insured; it is not required to disregard the interests of its shareholders and other policyholders when evaluating claims; and it is not required to pay noncovered claims, even though payment would be in the best interests of its insured.\u201d (<i>Love v.

Moreover, in some cases an employee's natural feelings of embarrassment, humiliation, and shame may provide a sufficient excuse for delay in reporting acts of sexual harassment by a supervisor.\" (<i>State Dept. of Health Services, supra</i>, 31 Cal.4th at p. 1045.)</p>"

Many of these power tools are run by large mechanical motors or hydraulically. These sorts of machines are difficult to stop while they are in their sequence of operation. Without guards, workers are susceptible to extremely serious injuries. For this reason, the Legislature passed section 4558, subdivision (b), which subjects employers to legal liability for removing guards from powerful machinery where the manufacturer has designed the machine to have a protective guard while in operation.\" (<i>Ceja v.</i></p><p><i>J.R. Wood, Inc.</i> (1987) 196 Cal.App.3d 1372, 1377 [242 Cal.Rptr. 531], internal citation omitted.)</p><p>\"This statutory definition embraces four elements. 'The power press itself is a machine.

An 'employer' is not excluded from the definition of a manufacturer, nor would doing so promote the objectives of the statute.\" (<i>Flowmaster, Inc., supra</i>, 16 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1029-1030, internal citation omitted.)</p><p>\"The element of knowledge requires 'actual awareness' by the employer\u2014rather than merely constructive knowledge\u2014that a point of operation guard has either been provided for or is required to prevent the probability of serious injury or death.\" (<i>Flowmaster, Inc., supra</i>, 16 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1031-1032, internal citation and footnote omitted.)</p><p>\"Liability under section 4558 can only be imposed if the employer fails to use or removes a safety device required by the manufacturer of the press. Essentially, the culpable conduct is the employer's ignoring of the manufacturer's safety directive . . ..

The second requirement follows from the principle that 'only the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain implicates the Eighth Amendment.' To violate the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause, a prison official must have a 'sufficiently culpable state of mind.' In prison-conditions cases that state of mind is one of 'deliberate indifference' to inmate health or safety . . ..\" (<i>Farmer v. Brennan</i> (1994) 511 U.S. 825, 834 [114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811], internal citations omitted.)</p><p>\"We hold . . . that a prison official cannot be found liable under the Eighth Amendment for denying an inmate humane conditions of confinement unless the official knows of and disregards an excessive risk to inmate health or safety; the official must both be aware of facts from which the inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm exists, and he must also draw the inference.\" (<i>Farmer, supra,</i> 511 U.S. at p. 837.)</p><p>\"Prison officials are deliberately indifferent to a prisoner's serious medical needs when they 'deny, delay or intentionally interfere with medical treatment.' . . .\" (<i>Wood v. Housewright</i> (9th Cir. 1990) 900  F.2d 1332, 1334, internal citation omitted.)</p><p>\"[A]llegations that a prison official has ignored the instructions of a prisoner's treating physician are sufficient to state a claim for deliberate indifference.\" (<i>Wakefield v. Thompson</i> (9th Cir. 1999) 177 F.3d 1160, 1165.)</p><p>\"[A] complaint that a physician has been negligent in diagnosing or treating a medical condition does not state a valid claim of medical mistreatment under the Eighth Amendment. Medical malpractice does not become a constitutional violation merely because the victim is a prisoner. In order to state a cognizable claim, a prisoner must allege acts or omissions sufficiently harmful to evidence deliberate indifference to serious medical needs.\" (<i>Estelle, supra,</i> 429 U.S. at p. 106.)</p><p>\"While poor medical treatment will at a certain point rise to the level of constitutional violation, mere malpractice, or even gross negligence, does not suffice. Although Wood's treatment was not as prompt or efficient as a free citizen might hope to receive, Wood was given medical care at the prison that addressed his needs.\" (<i>Wood, supra,</i> 900  F.2d at p. 1334.)</p><p>\"It has been recognized . . . that inadequate medical treatment may, in some instances, constitute a violation of 42 United States Code section 1983. In <i>Sturts v. City of Philadelphia,</i> for example, the plaintiff alleged that defendants acted 'carelessly, recklessly and negligently' when they failed to remove sutures from his eye, neck and face. The court concluded that although plaintiff was alleging inadequate medical treatment, he had stated a cause of action under section 1983: '. . . where a prisoner has received some medical attention and the dispute is over the adequacy of the treatment, federal courts are generally reluctant to second guess medical judgments. In some cases, however, the medical attention rendered may be so woefully inadequate as to amount to no treatment at all, thereby rising to the level of a \u00a7 1983 claim. . . .' \" (<i>Ochoa v.

The 'routine discomfort' that results from incarceration and which is 'part of the penalty that criminal offenders pay for their offenses against society' does not constitute a 'serious' medical need.\" (<i>Doty v. County of Lassen</i> (9th Cir. 1994) 37  F.3d 540, 546, internal citations and footnote omitted.)</p><p>\"The Supreme Court has interpreted the phrase 'under \"color\" of law' to mean 'under \"pretense\" of law.' A police officer's actions are under pretense of law only if they are 'in some way \"related to the performance of his official duties.' \" By contrast, an officer who is  ' \"pursuing his own goals and is not in any way subject to control by [his public employer],' \" does not act under color of law, unless he 'purports or pretends' to do so. Officers who engage in confrontations for personal reasons unrelated to law enforcement, and do not 'purport[] or pretend[]' to be officers, do not act under color of law.\" (<i>Huffman v.

The word \"business\" embraces everything about which one can be employed, and it is often synonymous with \"calling, occupation, or trade, engaged in for the purpose of making a livelihood or gain.\" The word \"establishment,\" as broadly defined, includes not only a fixed location, such as the \"place where one is permanently fixed for residence or business,\" but also a permanent \"commercial force or organization\" or \"a permanent settled position, (as in life or business).' \" (<i>O'Connor v.

Like the clause at issue here, this provision requires a determination of whether a defect 'substantially impairs' the value of goods sold to a buyer. Under it, the trier of fact may consider: 'the nature of the defects; the cost and length of time required for repair; whether past repair attempts have been successful; the degree to which the goods can be used while repairs are attempted; [inconvenience to buyer]; and the availability and cost of alternative goods pending repair. . . .'

(1986) 41 Cal.3d 962, 968  [227 Cal.Rptr. 106, 719 P.2d 676], the Supreme Court adopted the following analysis on scope of employment: \"A risk arises out of the employment when 'in the context of the particular enterprise an employee's conduct is not so unusual or startling that it would seem unfair to include the loss resulting from it among other costs of the employer's business. In other words, where the question is one of vicarious liability, the inquiry should be whether the risk was one \"that may fairly be regarded as typical of or broadly incidental\" to the enterprise undertaken by the employer.' Accordingly, the employer's liability extends beyond his actual or possible control of the employee to include risks inherent in or created by the enterprise.\"</p><p>California does not follow the traditional rule that an employee's actions are within the scope of employment only if motivated, in whole or part, by a desire to serve the employer's interests. (<i>Lisa M., supra, </i> 12 Cal.4th at p. 297.) However, the employee's motivation is a relevant factor in the scope of employment analysis. (<i>Id</i> at p. 298.)</p><p>In <i>Farmers, supra,</i> and later in <i>Lisa M., supra,</i> the Supreme Court adopted and employed the following \"foreseeability test\" from <i>Rodgers  v. Kemper Construction Co.</i> (1975) 50 Cal.App.3d 608, 618-619 [124 Cal.Rptr. 143]: \"One way to determine whether a risk is inherent in, or created by, an enterprise is to ask whether the actual occurrence was a generally foreseeable consequence of the activity. However, 'foreseeability' in this context must be distinguished from 'foreseeability' as a test for negligence. In the latter sense 'foreseeable' means a level of probability which would lead a prudent person to take effective precautions whereas 'foreseeability' as a test for respondeat uperior merely means that in the context of the particular enterprise an employee's conduct is not so unusual or startling that it would seem unfair to include the loss resulting from it among other costs of the employer's business.\"</p><p>In <i>Lisa M., supra</i>, the court first analyzed whether the wrongful conduct was \"engendered by\" or was an \"outgrowth\" of the perpetrator's employment. (<i>Lisa M., supra</i> at p. 300.) The court then applied the <i>Rodgers</i> foreseeability test: \"The employment . . . must be such as predictably to create the risk employees will commit [torts] of the type for which liability is sought.\" (<i>Id</i>. at p. 299.) The court reached the same result under both analyses [ultrasound technician who sexually assaulted a patient was not acting within the scope of employment].</p><p>Some courts have developed a two-prong test for determining whether an act is within the scope of employment. An act is within the scope of employment if it either (1) is required or incident to his duties, or  (2) could be reasonably foreseen by the employer in any event. If the employee's act satisfies either part of this two-prong test, then the employer is liable. (<i>Bailey v. Filco, Inc.</i> (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 1552, 1559 [56 Cal.Rptr.2d 333].) It has been noted that \"the foreseeability-based test and the two-prong test are not so much different tests, but different ways of articulating the same test for scope of employment.\" (<i>Id.</i> at p. 1561.)</p>"

In determining the reasonableness and necessity of monitoring, the following factors are relevant: (1) the significance and extent of the plaintiff's exposure to chemicals; (2) the toxicity of the chemicals; (3) the relative increase in the chance of onset of disease in the exposed plaintiff as a result of the exposure, when compared to (a) the plaintiff's chances of developing the disease had he or she not been exposed, and (b) the chances of the members of the public at large of developing the disease; (4) the seriousness of the disease for which the plaintiff is at risk; and (5) the clinical value of early detection and diagnosis. Under this holding, it is for the trier of fact to decide, on the basis of competent medical testimony, whether and to what extent the particular plaintiff's exposure to toxic chemicals in a given situation justifies future periodic medical monitoring.\" (<i>Potter, supra,</i> 6 Cal.4th at p. 1009.)</p><p>\"The crucial distinction, in other words, is in the nature of the monitoring, not the nature of the harm. '[E]ven if a defendant negligently exposes a smoker to toxins that significantly increase the smoker's risk of cancer, that defendant is not liable for reasonably certain future medical monitoring costs unless the recommended monitoring calls for tests or examinations that are in addition to or different from the type of monitoring that the smoker should prudently undertake regardless of the subsequent toxic exposure.' This accords with the policy concern being addressed in that part of [<i>Potter</i>], which was to avoid 'open[ing] the floodgates of litigation.' If 'the plaintiff already remains responsible for any monitoring that is shown to be medically advisable due solely to his or her smoking or other preexisting condition,' he or she will have no incentive to sue for contribution from a subsequent tortfeasor who has caused no need for additional or different monitoring.\" (<i>Gutierrez v.

Another relevant yardstick is the amount of compensatory damages awarded; in general, even an act of considerable reprehensibility will not be seen to justify a proportionally high amount of punitive damages if the actual harm suffered thereby is small. Also to be considered is the wealth of the particular defendant; obviously, the function of deterrence will not be served if the wealth of the defendant allows him to absorb the award with little or no discomfort.

Another relevant yardstick is the amount of compensatory damages awarded; in general, even an act of considerable reprehensibility will not be seen to justify a proportionally high amount of punitive damages if the actual harm suffered thereby is small. Also to be considered is the wealth of the particular defendant; obviously, the function of deterrence will not be served if the wealth of the defendant allows him to absorb the award with little or no discomfort.

To hold that a juror may be disqualified by a special verdict on negligence from participation in the next special verdict would deny the parties of 'the right to a jury of 12 persons deliberating on all issues.' Permitting any nine jurors to arrive at each special verdict best serves the purpose of less-than-unanimous verdicts, overcoming minor disagreements and avoiding costly mistrials.

However, each side, or each defendant, as provided in Section 231, shall be entitled to as many peremptory challenges to the alternate jurors as there are alternate jurors called.</p><p>The alternate jurors shall be seated so as to have equal power and facilities for seeing and hearing the proceedings in the  case, and shall take the same oath as the jurors already selected, and shall, unless excused by the court, attend at all times upon the trial of the cause in company with the other jurors, but shall not participate in deliberation unless ordered by the court, and for a failure to do so are liable to be punished for contempt.</p><p>They shall obey the orders of and be bound by the admonition of the court, upon each adjournment of the court; but if the regular jurors are ordered to be kept in the custody of the sheriff or marshal during the trial of the cause, the alternate jurors shall also be kept in confinement with the other jurors; and upon final submission of the case to the jury, the alternate jurors shall be kept in the custody of the sheriff or marshal who shall not suffer any communication to be made to them except by order of the court, and shall not be discharged until the original jurors are discharged, except as provided in this section.</p><p>If at any time, whether before or after the final submission of the case to the jury, a juror dies or becomes ill, or upon other good cause shown to the court is found to be unable to perform his or her duty, or if a juror requests a discharge and good cause appears therefor, the court may order the juror to  be discharged and draw the name of an alternate, who shall then take his or her place in the jury box, and be subject to the same rules and regulations as though he or she has been selected as one of the original jurors.</p><p>All laws relative to fees, expenses, and mileage or transportation of jurors shall be applicable to alternate jurors, except that in civil cases the sums for fees and mileage or transportation need not be deposited until the judge directs alternate jurors to be impaneled.</p>"
